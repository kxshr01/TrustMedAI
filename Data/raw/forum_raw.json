      "They are only guidelines.  Everyone has been given the ability to make choices and take responsibility.",
      "WEll of course, but we do not need the govt pandering to our \"cravings\" ... which I feel it does.",
      "If this is like my mom and mother in law they followed   doctors or charts to the T   and  said thats what I was told and thats what I am going to do.     I had to find out the hard way,   adjust and test that is all we can do,   my frustration with control is over because I took the bull by the horns.",

      "Well don't get too excited that they're \"getting it\" in terms of preventing obesity or backing down off the 'bad, bad fat' mantra. The whole 'reason' they're changing according to that news broadcast is simply that on the traditional food pyramid, even though shown in a smaller quantity, the things you 'weren't' supposed to eat were at the TOP of the pyramid. The USDA thinks that \"THAT'S\" that reason needed for the change. Don't hold your breath waiting for them to 'lower' the amount of 'carb servings' per day. Ain't gonna happen. That's the 'heart' of our whole 'food industry'. There's too much 'to lose' by telling people to back off on some carbs.\n\n\n\nAnd even on those 'health channels' you watch while waiting in the Dr's office, with that Dr. Sanje Gupta guy, on segments about diabetes diets they're always saying a 'diet high in lean meats, fruits and veggies (they got that almost right) and LOW in processed carbs AND saturated fat -- aargh... Low fat, lo carb.... \n\n\n\nThough I'm not afraid to say that part of me's still suspect about saturated fat being ok - especially if you have heart issues personally or in your family history. So much of heart health is genetic. If you have a good history -- eat all the 'butter' you want.. If not -- it's sorta Russian Roulette.\n\n\n\nBut I'm lovin' my new 'coconut oil' journey.",
      "I see this article directed to the general public not singling out diabetics or anyone else.  It may not be right for everyone but that is where choices and responsibility comes in.  My intention is not to start an argument.",
      "Sure they are only guidelines and everyone gets to make their own choices but how many folks base those choices on what the \"experts\" keep telling them is healthy? Those of us here on DD have had to stop and take a long hard look at what we eat... some here have had to make conscious choices about food since childhood and possibly take their insight for granted, but many people are not as savvy about nutrition and are swayed by the health claims of food labels and the latest \"super-food du jour\" \n\n\n\nIf it were an open discussion out there in the real word of all the possible options, I would agree there is free choice and full responsibility but instead: the media, nutritionists, TV cooking shows, advertising etc.. etc... present a one-sided and biased agenda.",
      "Gotta know what your choices are, and what is actually healthy, before you can choose well though. I know I thought carbs was da bomb, and fat was da eeeeeebil, BD. I am (and was) a farily educated, health-oriented person, too ... but nonetheless, CLUELESS.\n\n\n\nI actually had worked in a hospital D&N dept. as a researcher.  But they were \"experts,\" so I thought they knew what they were talking about until I got to know some of them ... it is just to easy to overlook reality when you are being bombarded with propaganda!\n\n\n\nThat is all, I did not think you were starting an argument, Dusty!",
      "Dr. Oz is educated.  Fat is the devil and carbs are wonderful he preaches.  Not sure that the pyramidis good advice for non diabetics. It would have been if you plowed 20 acres by hand but now even farmers don't.  My FF said a lady farmers on her knitting site just sets the auto-pilot on the seeding machine and knits away.",

      "Let's not forget that just because farmers don't plow by hand they don't have a physical job, along with construction workers, laborers, electricians, etc. My husband puts in a 12-14 hour day, and then on weekends he has to put in at least 8 hours around our house and his parents doing things that need to be done. If he wants a sandwich and wants bread, and then he wants chips with it I don't see a problem. Physically active healthy people can follow these guidelines to eat a healthy diet. Or, don't. \n\nI guess I just don't understand why this is such a big deal. There are so many different diseases and health problems that alot of people can't eat certain things. This is a guideline for healthy people. I am not trying to be argumentative here, really I am not. But, with everyone saying d is genetic, then how can this cause d? Why is this a bad thing?",
      "A common theme here on DD is that there is no \"one size fits all diet\" which works for everyone -- there is also apparently no consensus on what constitutes an healthy diet for everyone... so why is it even appropriate for the Government to be issuing \nany\n guidelines on what is healthy to eat?\n\n\n\nThese guidelines will be used to drive policies such as where your tax dollars get spent, and to determine the advice given to those who approach Doctors, Dietitians and other other health care professionals when looking for ways to get healthier.\n\n\n\nThe guidelines were NOT issued by any health department but rather by the US Department of AGRICULTURE. Yes they may cherry-pick an advisory committee of experts to help with the guidelines but the USDA have no compulsion to follow the advice of that committee... and the committee members are well aware of that up front, so inevitably they \"advise\" what is expected of them -- call it job security if you like. \n\n\n\nSurely the USDA's role is to support, promote and protect US agricultural producers domestically and internationally? What qualifies them to advise on healthy eating? I cannot be the only one who sees the potential for conflict of interest in that arrangement.",

But significant amounts of insulin are not produced because the new beta cells are promptly killed off. Eventually, the beta cell regeneration process stops. And having no GAD antibodies suggests that this has happened. In such a person, there would also be zero c-peptide. I suspect that most of us who have had T1 for 30+ years fall into this category. And the BCG treatment would not have any effect, unless if was combined with new implanted beta cells ...  \n.\n\n\n\nNext time I see a doctor,I am going to ask for an antibody and c-peptide test. The result will tell me if my pancreas is still making beta cells. I don't know if the doctor willagree to it, though.",

One drug to stop the autoimmune attack and one drug to regenerate beta cell mass.",
      "I didn't read anything new from this update, it just stated what dr Faustman has been saying for far too long! At the beggining I was really excited about this research but as it goes on, with the money that dr Faustman has spend and needs -as she states- to continue I am starting to wonder. Afterall this is a cheap drug that has been used. What does she need all that money for? If it works I say treat 2-3 people see it works and then continue, I dont think that figuring out a dose needs millions!",

I wonder if any pharmacutical companys are jumping to steal the information and hid it so no one else can ever find it. \n\n\n\nGood work Dr Faustman. Keep up the work.  Just keep the data  locked up and keep the key hidden so only your team knows where it is.  Maybe then a cure will actually be released to the public in the near future.",
      "Katerina, clinical trials take 8 years on average to complete. So two years to complete a phase 1 trial is completely normal. The FDA does not let you test the drug on two or three people and then move on. She needs to prove that this treatment has a positive effect in limited doses over hundreds or thousands of individuals that fit a diverse set of requirements. The study needs to be double-blind and randomized. This takes time and is expensive. \n\n\n\nFor an example of why this is expensive, you need only look at her lab equipment. To test if the treatment is having a positive effect on the \"bad\" t-cells, she built a machine that can sort 1 type of t-cell out of a million other blood cells. This machine costs millions of dollars and a team of engineers to build. And that's merely one small component of completing this project.\n\n\n\nTo put this in perspective, if she was creating a new drug, it would cost at least $1,000,000,000 - that's one billion dollars - to get to the start of a phase 1 clinical trial. The process to bring a treatment market is expensive and time-consuming no matter how you look at it. \n\n\n\nSo I would not look at the minor money involved here (well under $50,000,000) or the short time (less than 24 months to complete a phase 1 trial) and see anything but positive signs. As AlbertE said, most trials never even get to a phase II so this is actually good news all around.",

Also lab work is before clinical trials when you say you are ready to move into human clinical trials you do it on humans and see if it works so far dr Faustman has not proven anything on a real person. Dont get me wrong I hope all the best for her but I think she is fooling us and maybe herself I would really love to be wrong!!",

To test if the treatment is having a positive effect on the \"bad\" t-cells, she built a machine that can sort 1 type of t-cell out of a million other blood cells. This machine costs millions of dollars and a team of engineers to build. And that's merely one small component of completing this project.\n\n\n\nTo put this in perspective, if she was creating a new drug, it would cost at least $1,000,000,000 - that's one billion dollars - to get to the start of a phase 1 clinical trial. The process to bring a treatment market is expensive and time-consuming no matter how you look at it. \n\n\n\nSo I would not look at the minor money involved here (well under $50,000,000) or the short time (less than 24 months to complete a phase 1 trial) and see anything but positive signs. As AlbertE said, most trials never even get to a phase II so this is actually good news all around.",

      "There used to be a belief that once your beta cells are gone, they are gone for good. But it's now believed that the body continues making beta cells and just kills them off so quickly that you rarely see signs of them. Under this latter (and more likely) scenario, turning off the autoimmune response would cause your beta cells to regenerate. Even if this were not the case, it would allow you to implant beta cells generated from your own stem cells. So any way that you look at it, this would be a big piece of a biological cure.

One approach is encapsulating the cells in a protective layer and then giving localized immunosuppressant drugs right at the site of the transplant. Beta cells also crave oxygen, so there has been engineering work to create chemical reactions that can produce oxygen for 30 days while the beta cells attach to the vascular system. This approach means that you experience no side effects from the drugs (the doses are minuscule compared to taking a full body dose). Other approaches are using stem cells to culture beta cells that don't need immunosuppressants and encapsulating those to save them from the autoimmune response. Both of these approaches are working in animal models and headings towards human trials.\n\n\n\nThis stuff is miles ahead of where it was 5 years ago.",

It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy.  Dr William Davis  a cardiologist and author of Wheat Belly has a specific diet for promoting heart health.  He believes in Low Carb and moderate fat.

When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl.  That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones.\n\n\n\nA high LDL and a low HDL do matter.  Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem.   LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog.  \n\n\n\nLDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident.  Everytime there is an accident they show up to help.   Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem.   \n\n\n\nThe only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects.  Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins?   In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women!  Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run.  Ditto for people over 65.  No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner.  Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins!\n\n\n\nSo the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better.  Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see.\n\n\n\nBy the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion.  Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run.  I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",
      "If the observation that 50% of cardiac problems happen to those with normal or low LDL, and the other 50% happens to those with high LDL does not set off alarms in your brain, will anything?

I tolerated them until my dr quack quack doubled my dose.  \n\n\n\nAfter dropping statins and aforementioned dr, cholesterol went up about a 100 points to almost 270.

      "I think the medical community has done a real good job scaring us as patients into the danger of cholesterol.  Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad.  Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up.  Do statins work in a small amount of people probably.  But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time.  Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation.  I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart.  I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins.  I now take it to repair the damage.  After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly.  Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins.  A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic.   She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors.  So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease.  Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg.  She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't.

      "Seagul, If I were in your shoes, I would do exactly what you are doing and have the exact same opinions.  But, my Doc was trying to get me to go on a statin whenever I had NO documented, medical need for it.  Big difference."

Is it not dangerous then walking around with a high cholesterol count?\n\t\t\n\n\nClick to expand...\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you raise your HDL it will shut the doctor up ;-)  Start to take coconut oil, if dont already, and your hdl will jump.  When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl.  That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones.\n\n\n\nA high LDL and a low HDL do matter.  Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem.   LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog.  \n\n\n\nLDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident.  Everytime there is an accident they show up to help.   Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem.   \n\n\n\nThe only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects.  Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins?   In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women!  Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run.  Ditto for people over 65.  No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner.  Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins!\n\n\n\nSo the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better.  Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see.\n\n\n\nBy the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion.  Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run.  I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

      "Well don't get too excited that they're \"getting it\" in terms of preventing obesity or backing down off the 'bad, bad fat' mantra. The whole 'reason' they're changing according to that news broadcast is simply that on the traditional food pyramid, even though shown in a smaller quantity, the things you 'weren't' supposed to eat were at the TOP of the pyramid. The USDA thinks that \"THAT'S\" that reason needed for the change. Don't hold your breath waiting for them to 'lower' the amount of 'carb servings' per day. Ain't gonna happen. That's the 'heart' of our whole 'food industry'. There's too much 'to lose' by telling people to back off on some carbs.\n\n\n\nAnd even on those 'health channels' you watch while waiting in the Dr's office, with that Dr. Sanje Gupta guy, on segments about diabetes diets they're always saying a 'diet high in lean meats, fruits and veggies (they got that almost right) and LOW in processed carbs AND saturated fat -- aargh... Low fat, lo carb.... \n\n\n\nThough I'm not afraid to say that part of me's still suspect about saturated fat being ok - especially if you have heart issues personally or in your family history.

Those of us here on DD have had to stop and take a long hard look at what we eat... some here have had to make conscious choices about food since childhood and possibly take their insight for granted, but many people are not as savvy about nutrition and are swayed by the health claims of food labels and the latest \"super-food du jour\" \n\n\n\nIf it were an open discussion out there in the real word of all the possible options, I would agree there is free choice and full responsibility but instead: the media, nutritionists, TV cooking shows, advertising etc.. etc... present a one-sided and biased agenda.",

But significant amounts of insulin are not produced because the new beta cells are promptly killed off. Eventually, the beta cell regeneration process stops. And having no GAD antibodies suggests that this has happened. In such a person, there would also be zero c-peptide. I suspect that most of us who have had T1 for 30+ years fall into this category. And the BCG treatment would not have any effect, unless if was combined with new implanted beta cells ...  \n.\n\n\n\nNext time I see a doctor,I am going to ask for an antibody and c-peptide test. The result will tell me if my pancreas is still making beta cells. I don't know if the doctor willagree to it, though.",

At the beggining I was really excited about this research but as it goes on, with the money that dr Faustman has spend and needs -as she states- to continue I am starting to wonder. Afterall this is a cheap drug that has been used. What does she need all that money for? If it works I say treat 2-3 people see it works and then continue, I dont think that figuring out a dose needs millions!",

Just keep the data  locked up and keep the key hidden so only your team knows where it is.  Maybe then a cure will actually be released to the public in the near future.",
      "Katerina, clinical trials take 8 years on average to complete. So two years to complete a phase 1 trial is completely normal. The FDA does not let you test the drug on two or three people and then move on. She needs to prove that this treatment has a positive effect in limited doses over hundreds or thousands of individuals that fit a diverse set of requirements. The study needs to be double-blind and randomized. This takes time and is expensive. \n\n\n\nFor an example of why this is expensive, you need only look at her lab equipment. To test if the treatment is having a positive effect on the \"bad\" t-cells, she built a machine that can sort 1 type of t-cell out of a million other blood cells. This machine costs millions of dollars and a team of engineers to build. And that's merely one small component of completing this project.\n\n\n\nTo put this in perspective, if she was creating a new drug, it would cost at least $1,000,000,000 - that's one billion dollars - to get to the start of a phase 1 clinical trial. The process to bring a treatment market is expensive and time-consuming no matter how you look at it. \n\n\n\nSo I would not look at the minor money involved here (well under $50,000,000) or the short time (less than 24 months to complete a phase 1 trial) and see anything but positive signs. As AlbertE said, most trials never even get to a phase II so this is actually good news all around.",

And that's merely one small component of completing this project.\n\n\n\nTo put this in perspective, if she was creating a new drug, it would cost at least $1,000,000,000 - that's one billion dollars - to get to the start of a phase 1 clinical trial. The process to bring a treatment market is expensive and time-consuming no matter how you look at it. \n\n\n\nSo I would not look at the minor money involved here (well under $50,000,000) or the short time (less than 24 months to complete a phase 1 trial) and see anything but positive signs. As AlbertE said, most trials never even get to a phase II so this is actually good news all around.",

      "There used to be a belief that once your beta cells are gone, they are gone for good. But it's now believed that the body continues making beta cells and just kills them off so quickly that you rarely see signs of them. Under this latter (and more likely) scenario, turning off the autoimmune response would cause your beta cells to regenerate. Even if this were not the case, it would allow you to implant beta cells generated from your own stem cells. So any way that you look at it, this would be a big piece of a biological cure.

One approach is encapsulating the cells in a protective layer and then giving localized immunosuppressant drugs right at the site of the transplant. Beta cells also crave oxygen, so there has been engineering work to create chemical reactions that can produce oxygen for 30 days while the beta cells attach to the vascular system. This approach means that you experience no side effects from the drugs (the doses are minuscule compared to taking a full body dose). Other approaches are using stem cells to culture beta cells that don't need immunosuppressants and encapsulating those to save them from the autoimmune response. Both of these approaches are working in animal models and headings towards human trials.\n\n\n\nThis stuff is miles ahead of where it was 5 years ago.",

It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy.  Dr William Davis  a cardiologist and author of Wheat Belly has a specific diet for promoting heart health.  He believes in Low Carb and moderate fat.

When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl.  That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones.\n\n\n\nA high LDL and a low HDL do matter.  Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem.   LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog.  \n\n\n\nLDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident.  Everytime there is an accident they show up to help.   Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem.   \n\n\n\nThe only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects.  Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins?   In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women!  Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run.  Ditto for people over 65.  No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner.  Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins!\n\n\n\nSo the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better.  Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see.\n\n\n\nBy the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion.  Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run.  I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

      "I think the medical community has done a real good job scaring us as patients into the danger of cholesterol.  Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad.  Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up.  Do statins work in a small amount of people probably.  But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time.  Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation.  I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart.  I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins.  I now take it to repair the damage.  After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly.  Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins.  A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic.   She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors.  So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease.  Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg.  She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't.

    "best_answer": "april said:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tI'm not worried about it, but my Dr sure is. It was at it's highest 6 I remember, and she said 4 or below is what she wants a diabetic to have. Is it not dangerous then walking around with a high cholesterol count?\n\t\t\n\n\nClick to expand...\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you raise your HDL it will shut the doctor up ;-)  Start to take coconut oil, if dont already, and your hdl will jump.  When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl.  That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones.\n\n\n\nA high LDL and a low HDL do matter.  Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem.   LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog.  \n\n\n\nLDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident.  Everytime there is an accident they show up to help.   Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem.   \n\n\n\nThe only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects.  Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins?   In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women!  Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run.  Ditto for people over 65.  No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner.  Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins!\n\n\n\nSo the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better.  Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see.\n\n\n\nBy the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion.  Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run.  I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

The USDA thinks that \"THAT'S\" that reason needed for the change. Don't hold your breath waiting for them to 'lower' the amount of 'carb servings' per day. Ain't gonna happen. That's the 'heart' of our whole 'food industry'. There's too much 'to lose' by telling people to back off on some carbs.\n\n\n\nAnd even on those 'health channels' you watch while waiting in the Dr's office, with that Dr. Sanje Gupta guy, on segments about diabetes diets they're always saying a 'diet high in lean meats, fruits and veggies (they got that almost right) and LOW in processed carbs AND saturated fat -- aargh... Low fat, lo carb.... \n\n\n\nThough I'm not afraid to say that part of me's still suspect about saturated fat being ok - especially if you have heart issues personally or in your family history. So much of heart health is genetic. If you have a good history -- eat all the 'butter' you want.. If not -- it's sorta Russian Roulette.\n\n\n\nBut I'm lovin' my new 'coconut oil' journey.",
      "I see this article directed to the general public not singling out diabetics or anyone else.  It may not be right for everyone but that is where choices and responsibility comes in.  My intention is not to start an argument.",
      "Sure they are only guidelines and everyone gets to make their own choices but how many folks base those choices on what the \"experts\" keep telling them is healthy? Those of us here on DD have had to stop and take a long hard look at what we eat... some here have had to make conscious choices about food since childhood and possibly take their insight for granted, but many people are not as savvy about nutrition and are swayed by the health claims of food labels and the latest \"super-food du jour\" \n\n\n\nIf it were an open discussion out there in the real word of all the possible options, I would agree there is free choice and full responsibility but instead: the media, nutritionists, TV cooking shows, advertising etc.. etc... present a one-sided and biased agenda.",
      "Gotta know what your choices are, and what is actually healthy, before you can choose well though. I know I thought carbs was da bomb, and fat was da eeeeeebil, BD. I am (and was) a farily educated, health-oriented person, too ... but nonetheless, CLUELESS.\n\n\n\nI actually had worked in a hospital D&N dept. as a researcher.  But they were \"experts,\" so I thought they knew what they were talking about until I got to know some of them ... it is just to easy to overlook reality when you are being bombarded with propaganda!\n\n\n\nThat is all, I did not think you were starting an argument, Dusty!",
      "Dr. Oz is educated.  Fat is the devil and carbs are wonderful he preaches.  Not sure that the pyramidis good advice for non diabetics.

If he wants a sandwich and wants bread, and then he wants chips with it I don't see a problem. Physically active healthy people can follow these guidelines to eat a healthy diet. Or, don't. \n\nI guess I just don't understand why this is such a big deal. There are so many different diseases and health problems that alot of people can't eat certain things. This is a guideline for healthy people. I am not trying to be argumentative here, really I am not. But, with everyone saying d is genetic, then how can this cause d? Why is this a bad thing?",

That is not nearly as helpful as fat or fiber that reduces the rate you digest your carbs.  Most diabetes can only tolerate small amounts of carbs safely.  Sourdough will not help a 'normal' diabetic.  For the rest like me, it doesn't matter.  I will eat a whole wheat sandwich right after this post.  My PPs are near normal as long as I don't eat too much.  My problem is when I don't eat for more than 10 hrs.",

But significant amounts of insulin are not produced because the new beta cells are promptly killed off. Eventually, the beta cell regeneration process stops. And having no GAD antibodies suggests that this has happened. In such a person, there would also be zero c-peptide. I suspect that most of us who have had T1 for 30+ years fall into this category. And the BCG treatment would not have any effect, unless if was combined with new implanted beta cells ...  \n.\n\n\n\nNext time I see a doctor,I am going to ask for an antibody and c-peptide test. The result will tell me if my pancreas is still making beta cells. I don't know if the doctor willagree to it, though.",

Just keep the data  locked up and keep the key hidden so only your team knows where it is.  Maybe then a cure will actually be released to the public in the near future.",
      "Katerina, clinical trials take 8 years on average to complete. So two years to complete a phase 1 trial is completely normal.

She needs to prove that this treatment has a positive effect in limited doses over hundreds or thousands of individuals that fit a diverse set of requirements. The study needs to be double-blind and randomized. This takes time and is expensive. \n\n\n\nFor an example of why this is expensive, you need only look at her lab equipment. To test if the treatment is having a positive effect on the \"bad\" t-cells, she built a machine that can sort 1 type of t-cell out of a million other blood cells.

      "There used to be a belief that once your beta cells are gone, they are gone for good. But it's now believed that the body continues making beta cells and just kills them off so quickly that you rarely see signs of them. Under this latter (and more likely) scenario, turning off the autoimmune response would cause your beta cells to regenerate. Even if this were not the case, it would allow you to implant beta cells generated from your own stem cells. So any way that you look at it, this would be a big piece of a biological cure.

One approach is encapsulating the cells in a protective layer and then giving localized immunosuppressant drugs right at the site of the transplant. Beta cells also crave oxygen, so there has been engineering work to create chemical reactions that can produce oxygen for 30 days while the beta cells attach to the vascular system. This approach means that you experience no side effects from the drugs (the doses are minuscule compared to taking a full body dose). Other approaches are using stem cells to culture beta cells that don't need immunosuppressants and encapsulating those to save them from the autoimmune response. Both of these approaches are working in animal models and headings towards human trials.\n\n\n\nThis stuff is miles ahead of where it was 5 years ago.",

I think like a lot of other drugs statins may cause inflammation and it is the inflammation that caused my higher bgs.  But doesn't inflammation also cause heart disease?  So I really don't think how they can see there is any benefit .  A lot of us use a LC/HF diet to manage cholesterol.  It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy.  Dr William Davis  a cardiologist and author of Wheat Belly has a specific diet for promoting heart health.  He believes in Low Carb and moderate fat.  Dr Michael Eades also has a blog that pushes LC for heart health.  Little by little doctors are coming around that the important number is your HDL number.

When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl.  That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones.\n\n\n\nA high LDL and a low HDL do matter.  Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem.   LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog.  \n\n\n\nLDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident.  Everytime there is an accident they show up to help.   Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem.   \n\n\n\nThe only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects.  Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins?   In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women!  Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run.  Ditto for people over 65.  No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner.  Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins!\n\n\n\nSo the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better.  Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see.\n\n\n\nBy the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion.  Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run.  I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad.  Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up.  Do statins work in a small amount of people probably.  But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time.  Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation.  I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart.  I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins.  I now take it to repair the damage.  After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly.  Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins.  A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic.   She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors.  So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease.  Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg.  She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't.

Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem.   \n\n\n\nThe only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects.  Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins?   In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women!  Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run.  Ditto for people over 65.  No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner.  Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins!\n\n\n\nSo the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better.  Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see.\n\n\n\nBy the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion.  Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run.  I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

That is not nearly as helpful as fat or fiber that reduces the rate you digest your carbs.  Most diabetes can only tolerate small amounts of carbs safely.  Sourdough will not help a 'normal' diabetic.  For the rest like me, it doesn't matter.  I will eat a whole wheat sandwich right after this post.

And having no GAD antibodies suggests that this has happened. In such a person, there would also be zero c-peptide. I suspect that most of us who have had T1 for 30+ years fall into this category. And the BCG treatment would not have any effect, unless if was combined with new implanted beta cells ...  \n.\n\n\n\nNext time I see a doctor,I am going to ask for an antibody and c-peptide test.

One approach is encapsulating the cells in a protective layer and then giving localized immunosuppressant drugs right at the site of the transplant. Beta cells also crave oxygen, so there has been engineering work to create chemical reactions that can produce oxygen for 30 days while the beta cells attach to the vascular system. This approach means that you experience no side effects from the drugs (the doses are minuscule compared to taking a full body dose). Other approaches are using stem cells to culture beta cells that don't need immunosuppressants and encapsulating those to save them from the autoimmune response. Both of these approaches are working in animal models and headings towards human trials.\n\n\n\nThis stuff is miles ahead of where it was 5 years ago.",

      "I was only on statins for 15 months and my bgs were higher, especially towards the last few months when I had a lot of joint and muscle pain.  I think like a lot of other drugs statins may cause inflammation and it is the inflammation that caused my higher bgs.  But doesn't inflammation also cause heart disease?  So I really don't think how they can see there is any benefit .  A lot of us use a LC/HF diet to manage cholesterol.  It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy.  Dr William Davis  a cardiologist and author of Wheat Belly has a specific diet for promoting heart health.  He believes in Low Carb and moderate fat.  Dr Michael Eades also has a blog that pushes LC for heart health.  Little by little doctors are coming around that the important number is your HDL number.

When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl.  That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones.\n\n\n\nA high LDL and a low HDL do matter.  Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem.   LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog.  \n\n\n\nLDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident.  Everytime there is an accident they show up to help.   Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem.   \n\n\n\nThe only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects.  Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins?   In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women!  Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run.  Ditto for people over 65.  No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner.  Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins!\n\n\n\nSo the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better.  Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see.\n\n\n\nBy the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion.  Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run.  I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad.  Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up.  Do statins work in a small amount of people probably.  But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time.  Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation.  I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart.  I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins.  I now take it to repair the damage.  After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly.  Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins.  A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic.   She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors.  So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease.  Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg.  She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't.

I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Since I eat very few carbs, the sourdough doesn't seem to affect me as much as rice, white bread, potatoes, etc. I don't get groggy, and my extremities don't swell. But I only eat a couple slices at a time and haven't measure blood sugar diligently. But I do recommend it as long as you make it at home if you crave carbs like I do. It took me five years to lose the sugar craving, and I'm really just starting to work on the carb craving. It seems more difficult since there are always carbs around in one form or another.\n\n\n\nPS- you can get 50 lbs of flour for around $15, and sourdough is easy to make, just takes some time.",

And having no GAD antibodies suggests that this has happened. In such a person, there would also be zero c-peptide. I suspect that most of us who have had T1 for 30+ years fall into this category. And the BCG treatment would not have any effect, unless if was combined with new implanted beta cells ...  \n.\n\n\n\nNext time I see a doctor,I am going to ask for an antibody and c-peptide test.

One approach is encapsulating the cells in a protective layer and then giving localized immunosuppressant drugs right at the site of the transplant. Beta cells also crave oxygen, so there has been engineering work to create chemical reactions that can produce oxygen for 30 days while the beta cells attach to the vascular system. This approach means that you experience no side effects from the drugs (the doses are minuscule compared to taking a full body dose). Other approaches are using stem cells to culture beta cells that don't need immunosuppressants and encapsulating those to save them from the autoimmune response. Both of these approaches are working in animal models and headings towards human trials.\n\n\n\nThis stuff is miles ahead of where it was 5 years ago.",

      "I was only on statins for 15 months and my bgs were higher, especially towards the last few months when I had a lot of joint and muscle pain.  I think like a lot of other drugs statins may cause inflammation and it is the inflammation that caused my higher bgs.  But doesn't inflammation also cause heart disease?  So I really don't think how they can see there is any benefit .  A lot of us use a LC/HF diet to manage cholesterol.  It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy.  Dr William Davis  a cardiologist and author of Wheat Belly has a specific diet for promoting heart health.  He believes in Low Carb and moderate fat.  Dr Michael Eades also has a blog that pushes LC for heart health.  Little by little doctors are coming around that the important number is your HDL number.

When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl.  That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones.\n\n\n\nA high LDL and a low HDL do matter.  Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem.   LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog.  \n\n\n\nLDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident.  Everytime there is an accident they show up to help.   Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem.   \n\n\n\nThe only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects.  Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins?   In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women!  Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run.  Ditto for people over 65.  No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner.  Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins!\n\n\n\nSo the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better.  Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see.\n\n\n\nBy the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion.  Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run.  I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad.  Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up.  Do statins work in a small amount of people probably.  But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time.  Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation.  I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart.  I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins.  I now take it to repair the damage.  After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly.  Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins.  A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic.   She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors.  So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease.  Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg.  She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't.

I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Since I eat very few carbs, the sourdough doesn't seem to affect me as much as rice, white bread, potatoes, etc. I don't get groggy, and my extremities don't swell. But I only eat a couple slices at a time and haven't measure blood sugar diligently. But I do recommend it as long as you make it at home if you crave carbs like I do. It took me five years to lose the sugar craving, and I'm really just starting to work on the carb craving. It seems more difficult since there are always carbs around in one form or another.\n\n\n\nPS- you can get 50 lbs of flour for around $15, and sourdough is easy to make, just takes some time.",

And having no GAD antibodies suggests that this has happened. In such a person, there would also be zero c-peptide. I suspect that most of us who have had T1 for 30+ years fall into this category. And the BCG treatment would not have any effect, unless if was combined with new implanted beta cells ...  \n.\n\n\n\nNext time I see a doctor,I am going to ask for an antibody and c-peptide test.

One approach is encapsulating the cells in a protective layer and then giving localized immunosuppressant drugs right at the site of the transplant. Beta cells also crave oxygen, so there has been engineering work to create chemical reactions that can produce oxygen for 30 days while the beta cells attach to the vascular system. This approach means that you experience no side effects from the drugs (the doses are minuscule compared to taking a full body dose). Other approaches are using stem cells to culture beta cells that don't need immunosuppressants and encapsulating those to save them from the autoimmune response. Both of these approaches are working in animal models and headings towards human trials.\n\n\n\nThis stuff is miles ahead of where it was 5 years ago.",

      "I was only on statins for 15 months and my bgs were higher, especially towards the last few months when I had a lot of joint and muscle pain.  I think like a lot of other drugs statins may cause inflammation and it is the inflammation that caused my higher bgs.  But doesn't inflammation also cause heart disease?  So I really don't think how they can see there is any benefit .  A lot of us use a LC/HF diet to manage cholesterol.  It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy.  Dr William Davis  a cardiologist and author of Wheat Belly has a specific diet for promoting heart health.  He believes in Low Carb and moderate fat.  Dr Michael Eades also has a blog that pushes LC for heart health.  Little by little doctors are coming around that the important number is your HDL number.

When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl.  That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones.\n\n\n\nA high LDL and a low HDL do matter.  Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem.   LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog.  \n\n\n\nLDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident.  Everytime there is an accident they show up to help.   Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem.   \n\n\n\nThe only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects.  Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins?   In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women!  Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run.  Ditto for people over 65.  No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner.  Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins!\n\n\n\nSo the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better.  Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see.\n\n\n\nBy the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion.  Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run.  I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad.  Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up.  Do statins work in a small amount of people probably.  But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time.  Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation.  I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart.  I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins.  I now take it to repair the damage.  After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly.  Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins.  A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic.   She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors.  So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease.  Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg.  She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't.

I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Since I eat very few carbs, the sourdough doesn't seem to affect me as much as rice, white bread, potatoes, etc. I don't get groggy, and my extremities don't swell. But I only eat a couple slices at a time and haven't measure blood sugar diligently. But I do recommend it as long as you make it at home if you crave carbs like I do. It took me five years to lose the sugar craving, and I'm really just starting to work on the carb craving. It seems more difficult since there are always carbs around in one form or another.\n\n\n\nPS- you can get 50 lbs of flour for around $15, and sourdough is easy to make, just takes some time.",

And having no GAD antibodies suggests that this has happened. In such a person, there would also be zero c-peptide. I suspect that most of us who have had T1 for 30+ years fall into this category. And the BCG treatment would not have any effect, unless if was combined with new implanted beta cells ...  \n.\n\n\n\nNext time I see a doctor,I am going to ask for an antibody and c-peptide test.

One approach is encapsulating the cells in a protective layer and then giving localized immunosuppressant drugs right at the site of the transplant. Beta cells also crave oxygen, so there has been engineering work to create chemical reactions that can produce oxygen for 30 days while the beta cells attach to the vascular system. This approach means that you experience no side effects from the drugs (the doses are minuscule compared to taking a full body dose). Other approaches are using stem cells to culture beta cells that don't need immunosuppressants and encapsulating those to save them from the autoimmune response. Both of these approaches are working in animal models and headings towards human trials.\n\n\n\nThis stuff is miles ahead of where it was 5 years ago.",

      "I was only on statins for 15 months and my bgs were higher, especially towards the last few months when I had a lot of joint and muscle pain.  I think like a lot of other drugs statins may cause inflammation and it is the inflammation that caused my higher bgs.  But doesn't inflammation also cause heart disease?  So I really don't think how they can see there is any benefit .  A lot of us use a LC/HF diet to manage cholesterol.  It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy.  Dr William Davis  a cardiologist and author of Wheat Belly has a specific diet for promoting heart health.  He believes in Low Carb and moderate fat.  Dr Michael Eades also has a blog that pushes LC for heart health.  Little by little doctors are coming around that the important number is your HDL number.

When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl.  That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones.\n\n\n\nA high LDL and a low HDL do matter.  Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem.   LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog.  \n\n\n\nLDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident.  Everytime there is an accident they show up to help.   Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem.   \n\n\n\nThe only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects.  Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins?   In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women!  Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run.  Ditto for people over 65.  No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner.  Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins!\n\n\n\nSo the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better.  Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see.\n\n\n\nBy the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion.  Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run.  I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad.  Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up.  Do statins work in a small amount of people probably.  But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time.  Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation.  I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart.  I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins.  I now take it to repair the damage.  After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly.  Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins.  A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic.   She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors.  So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease.  Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg.  She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't.

I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Since I eat very few carbs, the sourdough doesn't seem to affect me as much as rice, white bread, potatoes, etc. I don't get groggy, and my extremities don't swell. But I only eat a couple slices at a time and haven't measure blood sugar diligently. But I do recommend it as long as you make it at home if you crave carbs like I do. It took me five years to lose the sugar craving, and I'm really just starting to work on the carb craving. It seems more difficult since there are always carbs around in one form or another.\n\n\n\nPS- you can get 50 lbs of flour for around $15, and sourdough is easy to make, just takes some time.",

And having no GAD antibodies suggests that this has happened. In such a person, there would also be zero c-peptide. I suspect that most of us who have had T1 for 30+ years fall into this category. And the BCG treatment would not have any effect, unless if was combined with new implanted beta cells ...  \n.\n\n\n\nNext time I see a doctor,I am going to ask for an antibody and c-peptide test.

One approach is encapsulating the cells in a protective layer and then giving localized immunosuppressant drugs right at the site of the transplant. Beta cells also crave oxygen, so there has been engineering work to create chemical reactions that can produce oxygen for 30 days while the beta cells attach to the vascular system. This approach means that you experience no side effects from the drugs (the doses are minuscule compared to taking a full body dose). Other approaches are using stem cells to culture beta cells that don't need immunosuppressants and encapsulating those to save them from the autoimmune response. Both of these approaches are working in animal models and headings towards human trials.\n\n\n\nThis stuff is miles ahead of where it was 5 years ago.",

      "I was only on statins for 15 months and my bgs were higher, especially towards the last few months when I had a lot of joint and muscle pain.  I think like a lot of other drugs statins may cause inflammation and it is the inflammation that caused my higher bgs.  But doesn't inflammation also cause heart disease?  So I really don't think how they can see there is any benefit .  A lot of us use a LC/HF diet to manage cholesterol.  It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy.  Dr William Davis  a cardiologist and author of Wheat Belly has a specific diet for promoting heart health.  He believes in Low Carb and moderate fat.  Dr Michael Eades also has a blog that pushes LC for heart health.  Little by little doctors are coming around that the important number is your HDL number.

When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl.  That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones.\n\n\n\nA high LDL and a low HDL do matter.  Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem.   LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog.  \n\n\n\nLDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident.  Everytime there is an accident they show up to help.   Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem.   \n\n\n\nThe only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects.  Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins?   In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women!  Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run.  Ditto for people over 65.  No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner.  Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins!\n\n\n\nSo the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better.  Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see.\n\n\n\nBy the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion.  Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run.  I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad.  Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up.  Do statins work in a small amount of people probably.  But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time.  Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation.  I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart.  I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins.  I now take it to repair the damage.  After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly.  Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins.  A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic.   She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors.  So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease.  Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg.  She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't.

I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Since I eat very few carbs, the sourdough doesn't seem to affect me as much as rice, white bread, potatoes, etc. I don't get groggy, and my extremities don't swell. But I only eat a couple slices at a time and haven't measure blood sugar diligently. But I do recommend it as long as you make it at home if you crave carbs like I do. It took me five years to lose the sugar craving, and I'm really just starting to work on the carb craving. It seems more difficult since there are always carbs around in one form or another.\n\n\n\nPS- you can get 50 lbs of flour for around $15, and sourdough is easy to make, just takes some time.",

And having no GAD antibodies suggests that this has happened. In such a person, there would also be zero c-peptide. I suspect that most of us who have had T1 for 30+ years fall into this category. And the BCG treatment would not have any effect, unless if was combined with new implanted beta cells ...  \n.\n\n\n\nNext time I see a doctor,I am going to ask for an antibody and c-peptide test.

One approach is encapsulating the cells in a protective layer and then giving localized immunosuppressant drugs right at the site of the transplant. Beta cells also crave oxygen, so there has been engineering work to create chemical reactions that can produce oxygen for 30 days while the beta cells attach to the vascular system. This approach means that you experience no side effects from the drugs (the doses are minuscule compared to taking a full body dose). Other approaches are using stem cells to culture beta cells that don't need immunosuppressants and encapsulating those to save them from the autoimmune response. Both of these approaches are working in animal models and headings towards human trials.\n\n\n\nThis stuff is miles ahead of where it was 5 years ago.",

      "I was only on statins for 15 months and my bgs were higher, especially towards the last few months when I had a lot of joint and muscle pain.  I think like a lot of other drugs statins may cause inflammation and it is the inflammation that caused my higher bgs.  But doesn't inflammation also cause heart disease?  So I really don't think how they can see there is any benefit .  A lot of us use a LC/HF diet to manage cholesterol.  It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy.  Dr William Davis  a cardiologist and author of Wheat Belly has a specific diet for promoting heart health.  He believes in Low Carb and moderate fat.  Dr Michael Eades also has a blog that pushes LC for heart health.  Little by little doctors are coming around that the important number is your HDL number.

When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl.  That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones.\n\n\n\nA high LDL and a low HDL do matter.  Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem.   LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog.  \n\n\n\nLDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident.  Everytime there is an accident they show up to help.   Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem.   \n\n\n\nThe only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects.  Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins?   In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women!  Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run.  Ditto for people over 65.  No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner.  Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins!\n\n\n\nSo the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better.  Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see.\n\n\n\nBy the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion.  Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run.  I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad.  Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up.  Do statins work in a small amount of people probably.  But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time.  Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation.  I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart.  I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins.  I now take it to repair the damage.  After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly.  Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins.  A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic.   She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors.  So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease.  Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg.  She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't.

I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Since I eat very few carbs, the sourdough doesn't seem to affect me as much as rice, white bread, potatoes, etc. I don't get groggy, and my extremities don't swell. But I only eat a couple slices at a time and haven't measure blood sugar diligently. But I do recommend it as long as you make it at home if you crave carbs like I do. It took me five years to lose the sugar craving, and I'm really just starting to work on the carb craving. It seems more difficult since there are always carbs around in one form or another.\n\n\n\nPS- you can get 50 lbs of flour for around $15, and sourdough is easy to make, just takes some time.",

And having no GAD antibodies suggests that this has happened. In such a person, there would also be zero c-peptide. I suspect that most of us who have had T1 for 30+ years fall into this category. And the BCG treatment would not have any effect, unless if was combined with new implanted beta cells ...  \n.\n\n\n\nNext time I see a doctor,I am going to ask for an antibody and c-peptide test.

One approach is encapsulating the cells in a protective layer and then giving localized immunosuppressant drugs right at the site of the transplant. Beta cells also crave oxygen, so there has been engineering work to create chemical reactions that can produce oxygen for 30 days while the beta cells attach to the vascular system. This approach means that you experience no side effects from the drugs (the doses are minuscule compared to taking a full body dose). Other approaches are using stem cells to culture beta cells that don't need immunosuppressants and encapsulating those to save them from the autoimmune response. Both of these approaches are working in animal models and headings towards human trials.\n\n\n\nThis stuff is miles ahead of where it was 5 years ago.",

      "I was only on statins for 15 months and my bgs were higher, especially towards the last few months when I had a lot of joint and muscle pain.  I think like a lot of other drugs statins may cause inflammation and it is the inflammation that caused my higher bgs.  But doesn't inflammation also cause heart disease?  So I really don't think how they can see there is any benefit .  A lot of us use a LC/HF diet to manage cholesterol.  It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy.  Dr William Davis  a cardiologist and author of Wheat Belly has a specific diet for promoting heart health.  He believes in Low Carb and moderate fat.  Dr Michael Eades also has a blog that pushes LC for heart health.  Little by little doctors are coming around that the important number is your HDL number.

When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl.  That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones.\n\n\n\nA high LDL and a low HDL do matter.  Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem.   LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog.  \n\n\n\nLDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident.  Everytime there is an accident they show up to help.   Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem.   \n\n\n\nThe only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects.  Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins?   In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women!  Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run.  Ditto for people over 65.  No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner.  Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins!\n\n\n\nSo the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better.  Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see.\n\n\n\nBy the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion.  Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run.  I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad.  Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up.  Do statins work in a small amount of people probably.  But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time.  Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation.  I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart.  I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins.  I now take it to repair the damage.  After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly.  Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins.  A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic.   She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors.  So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease.  Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg.  She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't.

I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Since I eat very few carbs, the sourdough doesn't seem to affect me as much as rice, white bread, potatoes, etc. I don't get groggy, and my extremities don't swell. But I only eat a couple slices at a time and haven't measure blood sugar diligently. But I do recommend it as long as you make it at home if you crave carbs like I do. It took me five years to lose the sugar craving, and I'm really just starting to work on the carb craving. It seems more difficult since there are always carbs around in one form or another.\n\n\n\nPS- you can get 50 lbs of flour for around $15, and sourdough is easy to make, just takes some time.",

And having no GAD antibodies suggests that this has happened. In such a person, there would also be zero c-peptide. I suspect that most of us who have had T1 for 30+ years fall into this category. And the BCG treatment would not have any effect, unless if was combined with new implanted beta cells ...  \n.\n\n\n\nNext time I see a doctor,I am going to ask for an antibody and c-peptide test.

One approach is encapsulating the cells in a protective layer and then giving localized immunosuppressant drugs right at the site of the transplant. Beta cells also crave oxygen, so there has been engineering work to create chemical reactions that can produce oxygen for 30 days while the beta cells attach to the vascular system. This approach means that you experience no side effects from the drugs (the doses are minuscule compared to taking a full body dose). Other approaches are using stem cells to culture beta cells that don't need immunosuppressants and encapsulating those to save them from the autoimmune response. Both of these approaches are working in animal models and headings towards human trials.\n\n\n\nThis stuff is miles ahead of where it was 5 years ago.",

      "I was only on statins for 15 months and my bgs were higher, especially towards the last few months when I had a lot of joint and muscle pain.  I think like a lot of other drugs statins may cause inflammation and it is the inflammation that caused my higher bgs.  But doesn't inflammation also cause heart disease?  So I really don't think how they can see there is any benefit .  A lot of us use a LC/HF diet to manage cholesterol.  It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy.  Dr William Davis  a cardiologist and author of Wheat Belly has a specific diet for promoting heart health.  He believes in Low Carb and moderate fat.  Dr Michael Eades also has a blog that pushes LC for heart health.  Little by little doctors are coming around that the important number is your HDL number.

When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl.  That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones.\n\n\n\nA high LDL and a low HDL do matter.  Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem.   LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog.  \n\n\n\nLDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident.  Everytime there is an accident they show up to help.   Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem.   \n\n\n\nThe only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects.  Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins?   In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women!  Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run.  Ditto for people over 65.  No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner.  Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins!\n\n\n\nSo the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better.  Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see.\n\n\n\nBy the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion.  Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run.  I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad.  Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up.  Do statins work in a small amount of people probably.  But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time.  Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation.  I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart.  I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins.  I now take it to repair the damage.  After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly.  Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins.  A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic.   She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors.  So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease.  Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg.  She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't.

I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Since I eat very few carbs, the sourdough doesn't seem to affect me as much as rice, white bread, potatoes, etc. I don't get groggy, and my extremities don't swell. But I only eat a couple slices at a time and haven't measure blood sugar diligently. But I do recommend it as long as you make it at home if you crave carbs like I do. It took me five years to lose the sugar craving, and I'm really just starting to work on the carb craving. It seems more difficult since there are always carbs around in one form or another.\n\n\n\nPS- you can get 50 lbs of flour for around $15, and sourdough is easy to make, just takes some time.",

And having no GAD antibodies suggests that this has happened. In such a person, there would also be zero c-peptide. I suspect that most of us who have had T1 for 30+ years fall into this category. And the BCG treatment would not have any effect, unless if was combined with new implanted beta cells ...  \n.\n\n\n\nNext time I see a doctor,I am going to ask for an antibody and c-peptide test.

One approach is encapsulating the cells in a protective layer and then giving localized immunosuppressant drugs right at the site of the transplant. Beta cells also crave oxygen, so there has been engineering work to create chemical reactions that can produce oxygen for 30 days while the beta cells attach to the vascular system. This approach means that you experience no side effects from the drugs (the doses are minuscule compared to taking a full body dose). Other approaches are using stem cells to culture beta cells that don't need immunosuppressants and encapsulating those to save them from the autoimmune response. Both of these approaches are working in animal models and headings towards human trials.\n\n\n\nThis stuff is miles ahead of where it was 5 years ago.",

      "I was only on statins for 15 months and my bgs were higher, especially towards the last few months when I had a lot of joint and muscle pain.  I think like a lot of other drugs statins may cause inflammation and it is the inflammation that caused my higher bgs.  But doesn't inflammation also cause heart disease?  So I really don't think how they can see there is any benefit .  A lot of us use a LC/HF diet to manage cholesterol.  It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy.  Dr William Davis  a cardiologist and author of Wheat Belly has a specific diet for promoting heart health.  He believes in Low Carb and moderate fat.  Dr Michael Eades also has a blog that pushes LC for heart health.  Little by little doctors are coming around that the important number is your HDL number.

When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl.  That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones.\n\n\n\nA high LDL and a low HDL do matter.  Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem.   LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog.  \n\n\n\nLDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident.  Everytime there is an accident they show up to help.   Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem.   \n\n\n\nThe only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects.  Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins?   In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women!  Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run.  Ditto for people over 65.  No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner.  Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins!\n\n\n\nSo the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better.  Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see.\n\n\n\nBy the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion.  Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run.  I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad.  Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up.  Do statins work in a small amount of people probably.  But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time.  Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation.  I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart.  I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins.  I now take it to repair the damage.  After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly.  Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins.  A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic.   She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors.  So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease.  Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg.  She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't.

I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Since I eat very few carbs, the sourdough doesn't seem to affect me as much as rice, white bread, potatoes, etc. I don't get groggy, and my extremities don't swell. But I only eat a couple slices at a time and haven't measure blood sugar diligently. But I do recommend it as long as you make it at home if you crave carbs like I do. It took me five years to lose the sugar craving, and I'm really just starting to work on the carb craving. It seems more difficult since there are always carbs around in one form or another.\n\n\n\nPS- you can get 50 lbs of flour for around $15, and sourdough is easy to make, just takes some time.",

And having no GAD antibodies suggests that this has happened. In such a person, there would also be zero c-peptide. I suspect that most of us who have had T1 for 30+ years fall into this category. And the BCG treatment would not have any effect, unless if was combined with new implanted beta cells ...  \n.\n\n\n\nNext time I see a doctor,I am going to ask for an antibody and c-peptide test.

One approach is encapsulating the cells in a protective layer and then giving localized immunosuppressant drugs right at the site of the transplant. Beta cells also crave oxygen, so there has been engineering work to create chemical reactions that can produce oxygen for 30 days while the beta cells attach to the vascular system. This approach means that you experience no side effects from the drugs (the doses are minuscule compared to taking a full body dose). Other approaches are using stem cells to culture beta cells that don't need immunosuppressants and encapsulating those to save them from the autoimmune response. Both of these approaches are working in animal models and headings towards human trials.\n\n\n\nThis stuff is miles ahead of where it was 5 years ago.",

      "I was only on statins for 15 months and my bgs were higher, especially towards the last few months when I had a lot of joint and muscle pain.  I think like a lot of other drugs statins may cause inflammation and it is the inflammation that caused my higher bgs.  But doesn't inflammation also cause heart disease?  So I really don't think how they can see there is any benefit .  A lot of us use a LC/HF diet to manage cholesterol.  It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy.  Dr William Davis  a cardiologist and author of Wheat Belly has a specific diet for promoting heart health.  He believes in Low Carb and moderate fat.  Dr Michael Eades also has a blog that pushes LC for heart health.  Little by little doctors are coming around that the important number is your HDL number.

When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl.  That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones.\n\n\n\nA high LDL and a low HDL do matter.  Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem.   LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog.  \n\n\n\nLDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident.  Everytime there is an accident they show up to help.   Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem.   \n\n\n\nThe only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects.  Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins?   In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women!  Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run.  Ditto for people over 65.  No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner.  Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins!\n\n\n\nSo the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better.  Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see.\n\n\n\nBy the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion.  Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run.  I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad.  Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up.  Do statins work in a small amount of people probably.  But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time.  Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation.  I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart.  I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins.  I now take it to repair the damage.  After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly.  Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins.  A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic.   She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors.  So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease.  Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg.  She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't.

I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Since I eat very few carbs, the sourdough doesn't seem to affect me as much as rice, white bread, potatoes, etc. I don't get groggy, and my extremities don't swell. But I only eat a couple slices at a time and haven't measure blood sugar diligently. But I do recommend it as long as you make it at home if you crave carbs like I do. It took me five years to lose the sugar craving, and I'm really just starting to work on the carb craving. It seems more difficult since there are always carbs around in one form or another.\n\n\n\nPS- you can get 50 lbs of flour for around $15, and sourdough is easy to make, just takes some time.",

And having no GAD antibodies suggests that this has happened. In such a person, there would also be zero c-peptide. I suspect that most of us who have had T1 for 30+ years fall into this category. And the BCG treatment would not have any effect, unless if was combined with new implanted beta cells ...  \n.\n\n\n\nNext time I see a doctor,I am going to ask for an antibody and c-peptide test.

One approach is encapsulating the cells in a protective layer and then giving localized immunosuppressant drugs right at the site of the transplant. Beta cells also crave oxygen, so there has been engineering work to create chemical reactions that can produce oxygen for 30 days while the beta cells attach to the vascular system. This approach means that you experience no side effects from the drugs (the doses are minuscule compared to taking a full body dose). Other approaches are using stem cells to culture beta cells that don't need immunosuppressants and encapsulating those to save them from the autoimmune response. Both of these approaches are working in animal models and headings towards human trials.\n\n\n\nThis stuff is miles ahead of where it was 5 years ago.",

      "I was only on statins for 15 months and my bgs were higher, especially towards the last few months when I had a lot of joint and muscle pain.  I think like a lot of other drugs statins may cause inflammation and it is the inflammation that caused my higher bgs.  But doesn't inflammation also cause heart disease?  So I really don't think how they can see there is any benefit .  A lot of us use a LC/HF diet to manage cholesterol.  It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy.  Dr William Davis  a cardiologist and author of Wheat Belly has a specific diet for promoting heart health.  He believes in Low Carb and moderate fat.  Dr Michael Eades also has a blog that pushes LC for heart health.  Little by little doctors are coming around that the important number is your HDL number.

When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl.  That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones.\n\n\n\nA high LDL and a low HDL do matter.  Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem.   LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog.  \n\n\n\nLDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident.  Everytime there is an accident they show up to help.   Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem.   \n\n\n\nThe only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects.  Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins?   In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women!  Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run.  Ditto for people over 65.  No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner.  Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins!\n\n\n\nSo the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better.  Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see.\n\n\n\nBy the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion.  Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run.  I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad.  Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up.  Do statins work in a small amount of people probably.  But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time.  Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation.  I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart.  I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins.  I now take it to repair the damage.  After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly.  Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins.  A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic.   She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors.  So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease.  Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg.  She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't.

I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Since I eat very few carbs, the sourdough doesn't seem to affect me as much as rice, white bread, potatoes, etc. I don't get groggy, and my extremities don't swell. But I only eat a couple slices at a time and haven't measure blood sugar diligently. But I do recommend it as long as you make it at home if you crave carbs like I do. It took me five years to lose the sugar craving, and I'm really just starting to work on the carb craving. It seems more difficult since there are always carbs around in one form or another.\n\n\n\nPS- you can get 50 lbs of flour for around $15, and sourdough is easy to make, just takes some time.",

And having no GAD antibodies suggests that this has happened. In such a person, there would also be zero c-peptide. I suspect that most of us who have had T1 for 30+ years fall into this category. And the BCG treatment would not have any effect, unless if was combined with new implanted beta cells ...  \n.\n\n\n\nNext time I see a doctor,I am going to ask for an antibody and c-peptide test.

One approach is encapsulating the cells in a protective layer and then giving localized immunosuppressant drugs right at the site of the transplant. Beta cells also crave oxygen, so there has been engineering work to create chemical reactions that can produce oxygen for 30 days while the beta cells attach to the vascular system. This approach means that you experience no side effects from the drugs (the doses are minuscule compared to taking a full body dose). Other approaches are using stem cells to culture beta cells that don't need immunosuppressants and encapsulating those to save them from the autoimmune response. Both of these approaches are working in animal models and headings towards human trials.\n\n\n\nThis stuff is miles ahead of where it was 5 years ago.",

      "I was only on statins for 15 months and my bgs were higher, especially towards the last few months when I had a lot of joint and muscle pain.  I think like a lot of other drugs statins may cause inflammation and it is the inflammation that caused my higher bgs.  But doesn't inflammation also cause heart disease?  So I really don't think how they can see there is any benefit .  A lot of us use a LC/HF diet to manage cholesterol.  It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy.  Dr William Davis  a cardiologist and author of Wheat Belly has a specific diet for promoting heart health.  He believes in Low Carb and moderate fat.  Dr Michael Eades also has a blog that pushes LC for heart health.  Little by little doctors are coming around that the important number is your HDL number.

When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl.  That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones.\n\n\n\nA high LDL and a low HDL do matter.  Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem.   LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog.  \n\n\n\nLDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident.  Everytime there is an accident they show up to help.   Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem.   \n\n\n\nThe only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects.  Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins?   In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women!  Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run.  Ditto for people over 65.  No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner.  Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins!\n\n\n\nSo the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better.  Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see.\n\n\n\nBy the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion.  Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run.  I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad.  Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up.  Do statins work in a small amount of people probably.  But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time.  Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation.  I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart.  I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins.  I now take it to repair the damage.  After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly.  Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins.  A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic.   She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors.  So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease.  Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg.  She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't.

I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Since I eat very few carbs, the sourdough doesn't seem to affect me as much as rice, white bread, potatoes, etc. I don't get groggy, and my extremities don't swell. But I only eat a couple slices at a time and haven't measure blood sugar diligently. But I do recommend it as long as you make it at home if you crave carbs like I do. It took me five years to lose the sugar craving, and I'm really just starting to work on the carb craving. It seems more difficult since there are always carbs around in one form or another.\n\n\n\nPS- you can get 50 lbs of flour for around $15, and sourdough is easy to make, just takes some time.",

And having no GAD antibodies suggests that this has happened. In such a person, there would also be zero c-peptide. I suspect that most of us who have had T1 for 30+ years fall into this category. And the BCG treatment would not have any effect, unless if was combined with new implanted beta cells ...  \n.\n\n\n\nNext time I see a doctor,I am going to ask for an antibody and c-peptide test.

One approach is encapsulating the cells in a protective layer and then giving localized immunosuppressant drugs right at the site of the transplant. Beta cells also crave oxygen, so there has been engineering work to create chemical reactions that can produce oxygen for 30 days while the beta cells attach to the vascular system. This approach means that you experience no side effects from the drugs (the doses are minuscule compared to taking a full body dose). Other approaches are using stem cells to culture beta cells that don't need immunosuppressants and encapsulating those to save them from the autoimmune response. Both of these approaches are working in animal models and headings towards human trials.\n\n\n\nThis stuff is miles ahead of where it was 5 years ago.",

      "I was only on statins for 15 months and my bgs were higher, especially towards the last few months when I had a lot of joint and muscle pain.  I think like a lot of other drugs statins may cause inflammation and it is the inflammation that caused my higher bgs.  But doesn't inflammation also cause heart disease?  So I really don't think how they can see there is any benefit .  A lot of us use a LC/HF diet to manage cholesterol.  It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy.  Dr William Davis  a cardiologist and author of Wheat Belly has a specific diet for promoting heart health.  He believes in Low Carb and moderate fat.  Dr Michael Eades also has a blog that pushes LC for heart health.  Little by little doctors are coming around that the important number is your HDL number.

When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl.  That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones.\n\n\n\nA high LDL and a low HDL do matter.  Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem.   LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog.  \n\n\n\nLDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident.  Everytime there is an accident they show up to help.   Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem.   \n\n\n\nThe only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects.  Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins?   In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women!  Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run.  Ditto for people over 65.  No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner.  Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins!\n\n\n\nSo the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better.  Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see.\n\n\n\nBy the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion.  Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run.  I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad.  Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up.  Do statins work in a small amount of people probably.  But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time.  Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation.  I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart.  I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins.  I now take it to repair the damage.  After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly.  Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins.  A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic.   She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors.  So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease.  Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg.  She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't.

I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Since I eat very few carbs, the sourdough doesn't seem to affect me as much as rice, white bread, potatoes, etc. I don't get groggy, and my extremities don't swell. But I only eat a couple slices at a time and haven't measure blood sugar diligently. But I do recommend it as long as you make it at home if you crave carbs like I do. It took me five years to lose the sugar craving, and I'm really just starting to work on the carb craving. It seems more difficult since there are always carbs around in one form or another.\n\n\n\nPS- you can get 50 lbs of flour for around $15, and sourdough is easy to make, just takes some time.",

And having no GAD antibodies suggests that this has happened. In such a person, there would also be zero c-peptide. I suspect that most of us who have had T1 for 30+ years fall into this category. And the BCG treatment would not have any effect, unless if was combined with new implanted beta cells ...  \n.\n\n\n\nNext time I see a doctor,I am going to ask for an antibody and c-peptide test.

One approach is encapsulating the cells in a protective layer and then giving localized immunosuppressant drugs right at the site of the transplant. Beta cells also crave oxygen, so there has been engineering work to create chemical reactions that can produce oxygen for 30 days while the beta cells attach to the vascular system. This approach means that you experience no side effects from the drugs (the doses are minuscule compared to taking a full body dose). Other approaches are using stem cells to culture beta cells that don't need immunosuppressants and encapsulating those to save them from the autoimmune response. Both of these approaches are working in animal models and headings towards human trials.\n\n\n\nThis stuff is miles ahead of where it was 5 years ago.",

      "I was only on statins for 15 months and my bgs were higher, especially towards the last few months when I had a lot of joint and muscle pain.  I think like a lot of other drugs statins may cause inflammation and it is the inflammation that caused my higher bgs.  But doesn't inflammation also cause heart disease?  So I really don't think how they can see there is any benefit .  A lot of us use a LC/HF diet to manage cholesterol.  It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy.  Dr William Davis  a cardiologist and author of Wheat Belly has a specific diet for promoting heart health.  He believes in Low Carb and moderate fat.  Dr Michael Eades also has a blog that pushes LC for heart health.  Little by little doctors are coming around that the important number is your HDL number.

When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl.  That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones.\n\n\n\nA high LDL and a low HDL do matter.  Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem.   LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog.  \n\n\n\nLDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident.  Everytime there is an accident they show up to help.   Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem.   \n\n\n\nThe only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects.  Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins?   In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women!  Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run.  Ditto for people over 65.  No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner.  Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins!\n\n\n\nSo the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better.  Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see.\n\n\n\nBy the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion.  Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run.  I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad.  Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up.  Do statins work in a small amount of people probably.  But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time.  Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation.  I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart.  I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins.  I now take it to repair the damage.  After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly.  Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins.  A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic.   She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors.  So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease.  Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg.  She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't.

I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Since I eat very few carbs, the sourdough doesn't seem to affect me as much as rice, white bread, potatoes, etc. I don't get groggy, and my extremities don't swell. But I only eat a couple slices at a time and haven't measure blood sugar diligently. But I do recommend it as long as you make it at home if you crave carbs like I do. It took me five years to lose the sugar craving, and I'm really just starting to work on the carb craving. It seems more difficult since there are always carbs around in one form or another.\n\n\n\nPS- you can get 50 lbs of flour for around $15, and sourdough is easy to make, just takes some time.",

And having no GAD antibodies suggests that this has happened. In such a person, there would also be zero c-peptide. I suspect that most of us who have had T1 for 30+ years fall into this category. And the BCG treatment would not have any effect, unless if was combined with new implanted beta cells ...  \n.\n\n\n\nNext time I see a doctor,I am going to ask for an antibody and c-peptide test.

One approach is encapsulating the cells in a protective layer and then giving localized immunosuppressant drugs right at the site of the transplant. Beta cells also crave oxygen, so there has been engineering work to create chemical reactions that can produce oxygen for 30 days while the beta cells attach to the vascular system. This approach means that you experience no side effects from the drugs (the doses are minuscule compared to taking a full body dose). Other approaches are using stem cells to culture beta cells that don't need immunosuppressants and encapsulating those to save them from the autoimmune response. Both of these approaches are working in animal models and headings towards human trials.\n\n\n\nThis stuff is miles ahead of where it was 5 years ago.",

      "I was only on statins for 15 months and my bgs were higher, especially towards the last few months when I had a lot of joint and muscle pain.  I think like a lot of other drugs statins may cause inflammation and it is the inflammation that caused my higher bgs.  But doesn't inflammation also cause heart disease?  So I really don't think how they can see there is any benefit .  A lot of us use a LC/HF diet to manage cholesterol.  It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy.  Dr William Davis  a cardiologist and author of Wheat Belly has a specific diet for promoting heart health.  He believes in Low Carb and moderate fat.  Dr Michael Eades also has a blog that pushes LC for heart health.  Little by little doctors are coming around that the important number is your HDL number.

When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl.  That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones.\n\n\n\nA high LDL and a low HDL do matter.  Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem.   LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog.  \n\n\n\nLDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident.  Everytime there is an accident they show up to help.   Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem.   \n\n\n\nThe only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects.  Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins?   In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women!  Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run.  Ditto for people over 65.  No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner.  Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins!\n\n\n\nSo the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better.  Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see.\n\n\n\nBy the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion.  Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run.  I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad.  Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up.  Do statins work in a small amount of people probably.  But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time.  Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation.  I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart.  I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins.  I now take it to repair the damage.  After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly.  Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins.  A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic.   She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors.  So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease.  Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg.  She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't.

I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Since I eat very few carbs, the sourdough doesn't seem to affect me as much as rice, white bread, potatoes, etc. I don't get groggy, and my extremities don't swell. But I only eat a couple slices at a time and haven't measure blood sugar diligently. But I do recommend it as long as you make it at home if you crave carbs like I do. It took me five years to lose the sugar craving, and I'm really just starting to work on the carb craving. It seems more difficult since there are always carbs around in one form or another.\n\n\n\nPS- you can get 50 lbs of flour for around $15, and sourdough is easy to make, just takes some time.",

And having no GAD antibodies suggests that this has happened. In such a person, there would also be zero c-peptide. I suspect that most of us who have had T1 for 30+ years fall into this category. And the BCG treatment would not have any effect, unless if was combined with new implanted beta cells ...  \n.\n\n\n\nNext time I see a doctor,I am going to ask for an antibody and c-peptide test.

One approach is encapsulating the cells in a protective layer and then giving localized immunosuppressant drugs right at the site of the transplant. Beta cells also crave oxygen, so there has been engineering work to create chemical reactions that can produce oxygen for 30 days while the beta cells attach to the vascular system. This approach means that you experience no side effects from the drugs (the doses are minuscule compared to taking a full body dose). Other approaches are using stem cells to culture beta cells that don't need immunosuppressants and encapsulating those to save them from the autoimmune response. Both of these approaches are working in animal models and headings towards human trials.\n\n\n\nThis stuff is miles ahead of where it was 5 years ago.",

      "I was only on statins for 15 months and my bgs were higher, especially towards the last few months when I had a lot of joint and muscle pain.  I think like a lot of other drugs statins may cause inflammation and it is the inflammation that caused my higher bgs.  But doesn't inflammation also cause heart disease?  So I really don't think how they can see there is any benefit .  A lot of us use a LC/HF diet to manage cholesterol.  It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy.  Dr William Davis  a cardiologist and author of Wheat Belly has a specific diet for promoting heart health.  He believes in Low Carb and moderate fat.  Dr Michael Eades also has a blog that pushes LC for heart health.  Little by little doctors are coming around that the important number is your HDL number.

When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl.  That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones.\n\n\n\nA high LDL and a low HDL do matter.  Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem.   LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog.  \n\n\n\nLDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident.  Everytime there is an accident they show up to help.   Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem.   \n\n\n\nThe only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects.  Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins?   In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women!  Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run.  Ditto for people over 65.  No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner.  Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins!\n\n\n\nSo the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better.  Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see.\n\n\n\nBy the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion.  Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run.  I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad.  Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up.  Do statins work in a small amount of people probably.  But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time.  Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation.  I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart.  I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins.  I now take it to repair the damage.  After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly.  Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins.  A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic.   She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors.  So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease.  Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg.  She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't.

I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Since I eat very few carbs, the sourdough doesn't seem to affect me as much as rice, white bread, potatoes, etc. I don't get groggy, and my extremities don't swell. But I only eat a couple slices at a time and haven't measure blood sugar diligently. But I do recommend it as long as you make it at home if you crave carbs like I do. It took me five years to lose the sugar craving, and I'm really just starting to work on the carb craving. It seems more difficult since there are always carbs around in one form or another.\n\n\n\nPS- you can get 50 lbs of flour for around $15, and sourdough is easy to make, just takes some time.",

And having no GAD antibodies suggests that this has happened. In such a person, there would also be zero c-peptide. I suspect that most of us who have had T1 for 30+ years fall into this category. And the BCG treatment would not have any effect, unless if was combined with new implanted beta cells ...  \n.\n\n\n\nNext time I see a doctor,I am going to ask for an antibody and c-peptide test.

One approach is encapsulating the cells in a protective layer and then giving localized immunosuppressant drugs right at the site of the transplant. Beta cells also crave oxygen, so there has been engineering work to create chemical reactions that can produce oxygen for 30 days while the beta cells attach to the vascular system. This approach means that you experience no side effects from the drugs (the doses are minuscule compared to taking a full body dose). Other approaches are using stem cells to culture beta cells that don't need immunosuppressants and encapsulating those to save them from the autoimmune response. Both of these approaches are working in animal models and headings towards human trials.\n\n\n\nThis stuff is miles ahead of where it was 5 years ago.",

      "I was only on statins for 15 months and my bgs were higher, especially towards the last few months when I had a lot of joint and muscle pain.  I think like a lot of other drugs statins may cause inflammation and it is the inflammation that caused my higher bgs.  But doesn't inflammation also cause heart disease?  So I really don't think how they can see there is any benefit .  A lot of us use a LC/HF diet to manage cholesterol.  It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy.  Dr William Davis  a cardiologist and author of Wheat Belly has a specific diet for promoting heart health.  He believes in Low Carb and moderate fat.  Dr Michael Eades also has a blog that pushes LC for heart health.  Little by little doctors are coming around that the important number is your HDL number.

When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl.  That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones.\n\n\n\nA high LDL and a low HDL do matter.  Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem.   LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog.  \n\n\n\nLDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident.  Everytime there is an accident they show up to help.   Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem.   \n\n\n\nThe only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects.  Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins?   In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women!  Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run.  Ditto for people over 65.  No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner.  Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins!\n\n\n\nSo the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better.  Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see.\n\n\n\nBy the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion.  Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run.  I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",

Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad.  Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up.  Do statins work in a small amount of people probably.  But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time.  Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation.  I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart.  I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins.  I now take it to repair the damage.  After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly.  Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins.  A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic.   She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors.  So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease.  Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg.  She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't.

I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up....  well you get the picture.\n\n\n\n....",
