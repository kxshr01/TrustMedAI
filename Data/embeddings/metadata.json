If you have not been active, talk with your health care professional about which activities are best. Start slowly and build up to your goal.\n- Eat healthy foods.Eat smaller portions to reduce the amount of calories you eat each day and help you lose weight. Choosing foods with less fat is another way to reduce calories. Drink water instead of sweetened beverages.\nAsk your health care team what other changes you can make to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes.\nMost often, your best chance for preventing type 2 diabetes is to make lifestyle changes that work for you long term.

Click to expand... what? \"Pandering (politics), the expression of one's views in a manner that appeals to voters\"\nWell don't get too excited that they're \"getting it\" in terms of preventing obesity or backing down off the 'bad, bad fat' mantra. The whole 'reason' they're changing according to that news broadcast is simply that on the traditional food pyramid, even though shown in a smaller quantity, the things you 'weren't' supposed to eat were at the TOP of the pyramid. The USDA thinks that \"THAT'S\" that reason needed for the change. Don't hold your breath waiting for them to 'lower' the amount of 'carb servings' per day. Ain't gonna happen. That's the 'heart' of our whole 'food industry'. There's too much 'to lose' by telling people to back off on some carbs. And even on those 'health channels' you watch while waiting in the Dr's office, with that Dr. Sanje Gupta guy, on segments about diabetes diets they're always saying a 'diet high in lean meats, fruits and veggies (they got that almost right) and LOW in processed carbs AND saturated fat -- aargh... Low fat, lo carb.... Though I'm not afraid to say that part of me's still suspect about saturated fat being ok - especially if you have heart issues personally or in your family history. So much of heart health is genetic. If you have a good history -- eat all the 'butter' you want.. If not -- it's sorta Russian Roulette. But I'm lovin' my new 'coconut oil' journey.\nI see this article directed to the general public not singling out diabetics or anyone else. It may not be right for everyone but that is where choices and responsibility comes in. My intention is not to start an argument.\nSure they are only guidelines and everyone gets to make their own choices but how many folks base those choices on what the \"experts\" keep telling them is healthy? Those of us here on DD have had to stop and take a long hard look at what we eat... some here have had to make conscious choices about food since childhood and possibly take their insight for granted, but many people are not as savvy about nutrition and are swayed by the health claims of food labels and the latest \"super-food du jour\" If it were an open discussion out there in the real word of all the possible options, I would agree there is free choice and full responsibility but instead: the media, nutritionists, TV cooking shows, advertising etc.. etc... present a one-sided and biased agenda.\nGotta know what your choices are, and what is actually healthy, before you can choose well though. I know I thought carbs was da bomb, and fat was da eeeeeebil, BD. I am (and was) a farily educated, health-oriented person, too ... but nonetheless, CLUELESS. I actually had worked in a hospital D&N dept. as a researcher. But they were \"experts,\" so I thought they knew what they were talking about until I got to know some of them ... it is just to easy to overlook reality when you are being bombarded with propaganda! That is all, I did not think you were starting an argument, Dusty!\nDr. Oz is educated. Fat is the devil and carbs are wonderful he preaches. Not sure that the pyramidis good advice for non diabetics. It would have been if you plowed 20 acres by hand but now even farmers don't.

Why is this a bad thing?\nA common theme here on DD is that there is no \"one size fits all diet\" which works for everyone -- there is also apparently no consensus on what constitutes an healthy diet for everyone... so why is it even appropriate for the Government to be issuing any guidelines on what is healthy to eat? These guidelines will be used to drive policies such as where your tax dollars get spent, and to determine the advice given to those who approach Doctors, Dietitians and other other health care professionals when looking for ways to get healthier. The guidelines were NOT issued by any health department but rather by the US Department of AGRICULTURE. Yes they may cherry-pick an advisory committee of experts to help with the guidelines but the USDA have no compulsion to follow the advice of that committee... and the committee members are well aware of that up front, so inevitably they \"advise\" what is expected of them -- call it job security if you like.

The whole 'reason' they're changing according to that news broadcast is simply that on the traditional food pyramid, even though shown in a smaller quantity, the things you 'weren't' supposed to eat were at the TOP of the pyramid. The USDA thinks that \"THAT'S\" that reason needed for the change. Don't hold your breath waiting for them to 'lower' the amount of 'carb servings' per day. Ain't gonna happen. That's the 'heart' of our whole 'food industry'. There's too much 'to lose' by telling people to back off on some carbs. And even on those 'health channels' you watch while waiting in the Dr's office, with that Dr. Sanje Gupta guy, on segments about diabetes diets they're always saying a 'diet high in lean meats, fruits and veggies (they got that almost right) and LOW in processed carbs AND saturated fat -- aargh... Low fat, lo carb.... Though I'm not afraid to say that part of me's still suspect about saturated fat being ok - especially if you have heart issues personally or in your family history.

My intention is not to start an argument.\nSure they are only guidelines and everyone gets to make their own choices but how many folks base those choices on what the \"experts\" keep telling them is healthy? Those of us here on DD have had to stop and take a long hard look at what we eat... some here have had to make conscious choices about food since childhood and possibly take their insight for granted, but many people are not as savvy about nutrition and are swayed by the health claims of food labels and the latest \"super-food du jour\" If it were an open discussion out there in the real word of all the possible options, I would agree there is free choice and full responsibility but instead: the media, nutritionists, TV cooking shows, advertising etc.. etc... present a one-sided and biased agenda.\nGotta know what your choices are, and what is actually healthy, before you can choose well though.

Why is this a bad thing?\nA common theme here on DD is that there is no \"one size fits all diet\" which works for everyone -- there is also apparently no consensus on what constitutes an healthy diet for everyone... so why is it even appropriate for the Government to be issuing any guidelines on what is healthy to eat? These guidelines will be used to drive policies such as where your tax dollars get spent, and to determine the advice given to those who approach Doctors, Dietitians and other other health care professionals when looking for ways to get healthier. The guidelines were NOT issued by any health department but rather by the US Department of AGRICULTURE. Yes they may cherry-pick an advisory committee of experts to help with the guidelines but the USDA have no compulsion to follow the advice of that committee... and the committee members are well aware of that up front, so inevitably they \"advise\" what is expected of them -- call it job security if you like. Surely the USDA's role is to support, promote and protect US agricultural producers domestically and internationally? What qualifies them to advise on healthy eating? I cannot be the only one who sees the potential for conflict of interest in that arrangement.\nmoon2 said: And if she gets tired, she can knit on a machine too. Click to expand... GASP!

I see it as a way to help people try to eat and live a healthy lifestyle.\nI also do not see \"conspiracy\"... instead I see that there are powerful lobby groups with a vested interest in making money and maintaining their job security. I'd rather not get my healthy eating advice from the food producers thanks... for the same reason that I don't take my car-buying advice from a used-car salesman -- not because I think he is in any conspiracy but because I expect he will try to do his job of selling cars.

I'm not a fan of Opera or Dr. Oz but my wife is encouraging me to watch this show. With what I can see that may be coming in the future I set aside my thoughts and will watch this. I feel that I am better off learning everything that I can about this (T2) as I can. It can't hurt. The show is on this afternoon 02-24-10. I don't know what time or what channel but it just might be worth watching. Thought I would just throw this out there. Leland\nI use to like him several years ago but he has this belief that diabetes is caused by diabetics stuffing their faces and if we just lose the weight we will be cured. All I know is I am a very healthy eater at 122 pounds and exercise 2-3 hours a day and am still diabetic. He makes it seem very simple which it is not.\nI know it isn't simple. I have found this out. My thought is what the heck, it won't hurt to hear what he has to say. It may be of some help to those that are new to all of this. At least it may give some direction and like I said, it can't hurt. Leland\nI have all his books. He is a big low fat diet person.\nLike I posted in Amylia Graces blog, I don't have a whole lot of faith in a doctor who comments that you have a touch of the suger. In all that I've seen on his show when he discusses diabetes I don't think he's that on the ball! I love the guy and watch him everyday but when he talks about D I kind of shake my head.\nI have watched Dr. Oz and heard his thoughts on D. I am a t1 on a pump and yes I do eat low fat and low carb, exercise and all of what i am sapposed to do. I have had this going on 7 years and I think that yes we can always learn something new. I do think that if he was all that great he wouldnt be on TV. This is my opinion.\nIf he decides to have diabetics on the stage I bet they are all overweight and have eaten unhealthy diets most of their lives. I agree we need to stop the epidemeic of diabeties and everyone should eat healthy. I wonder if he will talk about the relation of eating carbs and high bgs. We all know low carb diets work to control diabetes. I bet you he won't touch that with a 10 foot pole.\nWell he believes your to eat veggies and whole grains and I have seen him change his tune since he first came on talking about diabetes.

Leland\nI have all his books. He is a big low fat diet person.\nLike I posted in Amylia Graces blog, I don't have a whole lot of faith in a doctor who comments that you have a touch of the suger. In all that I've seen on his show when he discusses diabetes I don't think he's that on the ball! I love the guy and watch him everyday but when he talks about D I kind of shake my head.\nI have watched Dr. Oz and heard his thoughts on D. I am a t1 on a pump and yes I do eat low fat and low carb, exercise and all of what i am sapposed to do. I have had this going on 7 years and I think that yes we can always learn something new. I do think that if he was all that great he wouldnt be on TV. This is my opinion.\nIf he decides to have diabetics on the stage I bet they are all overweight and have eaten unhealthy diets most of their lives. I agree we need to stop the epidemeic of diabeties and everyone should eat healthy. I wonder if he will talk about the relation of eating carbs and high bgs. We all know low carb diets work to control diabetes. I bet you he won't touch that with a 10 foot pole.\nWell he believes your to eat veggies and whole grains and I have seen him change his tune since he first came on talking about diabetes. He does believe it all can be cured by just eating his way and losing weight.\nThanks were going to record it, its going to have Dr. Oz on it but I know where he is coming from already as he thinks type 2 can be cured.\nDont miss it! Oprah, is having a special tomorrow on americas epidemic diabetes....\" A silent killer\" will have to watch.\nWell it has Dr. Oz on it and I pretty much know what he is going to say. Lose weight and you wont be diabetic, he has said as much on his show before. Unless he has changed what he shows people to eat it will still shoot my bs up. I am taping it and I hope its a little more understanding that this disease is not all about weight.\nYeah, thanks for the alert. Dr. Oz is so NOT a good person when it comes to diabetes advice. Who knows, maybe she'll have someone else on. Wouldn't it be great if she actually had some real diabetics with real stories on? That I'd like to see.\nMy daughter in law is an avid Do Oz fan and was shocked when I told her that I still had diabetes. She told me Dr Oz says that when you lose the weight the diabetes goes away. Well, I had to reeducate her and told her that even on low carb, extreme exercise and good bg numbers, I would always be a diabetic.\nfurball64801 said: well it has dr.

I'm not a fan of Opera or Dr. Oz but my wife is encouraging me to watch this show. With what I can see that may be coming in the future I set aside my thoughts and will watch this.

All I know is I am a very healthy eater at 122 pounds and exercise 2-3 hours a day and am still diabetic. He makes it seem very simple which it is not.\nI know it isn't simple. I have found this out. My thought is what the heck, it won't hurt to hear what he has to say. It may be of some help to those that are new to all of this. At least it may give some direction and like I said, it can't hurt. Leland\nI have all his books. He is a big low fat diet person.\nLike I posted in Amylia Graces blog, I don't have a whole lot of faith in a doctor who comments that you have a touch of the suger. In all that I've seen on his show when he discusses diabetes I don't think he's that on the ball! I love the guy and watch him everyday but when he talks about D I kind of shake my head.\nI have watched Dr. Oz and heard his thoughts on D. I am a t1 on a pump and yes I do eat low fat and low carb, exercise and all of what i am sapposed to do. I have had this going on 7 years and I think that yes we can always learn something new. I do think that if he was all that great he wouldnt be on TV. This is my opinion.\nIf he decides to have diabetics on the stage I bet they are all overweight and have eaten unhealthy diets most of their lives. I agree we need to stop the epidemeic of diabeties and everyone should eat healthy. I wonder if he will talk about the relation of eating carbs and high bgs. We all know low carb diets work to control diabetes. I bet you he won't touch that with a 10 foot pole.\nWell he believes your to eat veggies and whole grains and I have seen him change his tune since he first came on talking about diabetes. He does believe it all can be cured by just eating his way and losing weight.\nThanks were going to record it, its going to have Dr. Oz on it but I know where he is coming from already as he thinks type 2 can be cured.\nDont miss it! Oprah, is having a special tomorrow on americas epidemic diabetes....\" A silent killer\" will have to watch.\nWell it has Dr. Oz on it and I pretty much know what he is going to say. Lose weight and you wont be diabetic, he has said as much on his show before. Unless he has changed what he shows people to eat it will still shoot my bs up. I am taping it and I hope its a little more understanding that this disease is not all about weight.\nYeah, thanks for the alert. Dr. Oz is so NOT a good person when it comes to diabetes advice. Who knows, maybe she'll have someone else on. Wouldn't it be great if she actually had some real diabetics with real stories on? That I'd like to see.\nMy daughter in law is an avid Do Oz fan and was shocked when I told her that I still had diabetes. She told me Dr Oz says that when you lose the weight the diabetes goes away. Well, I had to reeducate her and told her that even on low carb, extreme exercise and good bg numbers, I would always be a diabetic.\nfurball64801 said: well it has dr.

Leland\nI use to like him several years ago but he has this belief that diabetes is caused by diabetics stuffing their faces and if we just lose the weight we will be cured. All I know is I am a very healthy eater at 122 pounds and exercise 2-3 hours a day and am still diabetic. He makes it seem very simple which it is not.\nI know it isn't simple. I have found this out. My thought is what the heck, it won't hurt to hear what he has to say. It may be of some help to those that are new to all of this. At least it may give some direction and like I said, it can't hurt. Leland\nI have all his books. He is a big low fat diet person.\nLike I posted in Amylia Graces blog, I don't have a whole lot of faith in a doctor who comments that you have a touch of the suger. In all that I've seen on his show when he discusses diabetes I don't think he's that on the ball! I love the guy and watch him everyday but when he talks about D I kind of shake my head.\nI have watched Dr. Oz and heard his thoughts on D. I am a t1 on a pump and yes I do eat low fat and low carb, exercise and all of what i am sapposed to do. I have had this going on 7 years and I think that yes we can always learn something new. I do think that if he was all that great he wouldnt be on TV. This is my opinion.\nIf he decides to have diabetics on the stage I bet they are all overweight and have eaten unhealthy diets most of their lives. I agree we need to stop the epidemeic of diabeties and everyone should eat healthy. I wonder if he will talk about the relation of eating carbs and high bgs. We all know low carb diets work to control diabetes. I bet you he won't touch that with a 10 foot pole.\nWell he believes your to eat veggies and whole grains and I have seen him change his tune since he first came on talking about diabetes. He does believe it all can be cured by just eating his way and losing weight.\nThanks were going to record it, its going to have Dr. Oz on it but I know where he is coming from already as he thinks type 2 can be cured.\nDont miss it! Oprah, is having a special tomorrow on americas epidemic diabetes....\" A silent killer\" will have to watch.\nWell it has Dr. Oz on it and I pretty much know what he is going to say. Lose weight and you wont be diabetic, he has said as much on his show before. Unless he has changed what he shows people to eat it will still shoot my bs up. I am taping it and I hope its a little more understanding that this disease is not all about weight.\nYeah, thanks for the alert. Dr. Oz is so NOT a good person when it comes to diabetes advice. Who knows, maybe she'll have someone else on. Wouldn't it be great if she actually had some real diabetics with real stories on? That I'd like to see.\nMy daughter in law is an avid Do Oz fan and was shocked when I told her that I still had diabetes. She told me Dr Oz says that when you lose the weight the diabetes goes away.

I make sourdough at home and use whole wheat flour. I am back to prediabetic after being diagnosed with type II. Lost some weight, and eliminated most carbs. The starter I use has been acclimated to whole wheat and I love it. Since I eat very few carbs, the sourdough doesn't seem to affect me as much as rice, white bread, potatoes, etc. I don't get groggy, and my extremities don't swell. But I only eat a couple slices at a time and haven't measure blood sugar diligently. But I do recommend it as long as you make it at home if you crave carbs like I do. It took me five years to lose the sugar craving, and I'm really just starting to work on the carb craving. It seems more difficult since there are always carbs around in one form or another. PS- you can get 50 lbs of flour for around $15, and sourdough is easy to make, just takes some time.\nWelcome to DD. Just so you know, the last post in this thread was nearly five years ago. Please feel free to tell us about yourself and your diabetes by starting a new thread in the Introduce Yourself forum.\ndmac, you must have really read everything to come up with this. My hats off to you! Welcome to the forum. I like this forum the best. It has a great mix of users. I even like the moderators better than some forums. Acids increase the time your food stays in your stomach. That is not nearly as helpful as fat or fiber that reduces the rate you digest your carbs. Most diabetes can only tolerate small amounts of carbs safely. Sourdough will not help a 'normal' diabetic. For the rest like me, it doesn't matter. I will eat a whole wheat sandwich right after this post. My PPs are near normal as long as I don't eat too much. My problem is when I don't eat for more than 10 hrs.\njwags said: This is a really old thread, you might want to start a new one. I also agree that most bread is not made with a sour dough starter. Always use your meter to test. Click to expand... The old thread has interesting info in spite of dating. I did my first test locally made sourdough bread. I didn\u2019t have much reaction. Einkorn made w just one tablespoon of honey spiked me almost 100 points. The Sourdough bread raised me about 20. Weird. Sent from my iPhone using Diabetes Daily\nI had heard about the sourdough giving less of a spike than regular or other breads, tried a half slice and spiked high.Type 2\nSourdough bread did HORRIBLE things to my low BG/weight loss efforts. I read somewhere that sourdough bread was fine for diabetics to eat. So I started eating it everyday for lunch. Big, freshly baked, thick slices. Good quality sourdough. One, two, or even three slices. It was awesome. Ate it for a couple of months. It was also the reason I went through the carb flu a second time - that lasted almost a week, with me literally face down in a pillow during most of that time. And the reason I finally went out and bought a glucose meter. And it knocked my weight loss efforts completely off-track. It sent my BG sky high. Probably had a good 3 month \"remission\" from my remission, if you catch my drift. Never again. That stuff might as well be Wonderbread, as far as my BG is concerned. Don't let the \"but sourdough starter is different\" talk fool you. Yes I know everyone is different, but this was the single worst mistake I ever made diet-wise on my diabetes journey, hands down.\nI absolutely love sourdough bread. I don't eat it though.

I make sourdough at home and use whole wheat flour. I am back to prediabetic after being diagnosed with type II. Lost some weight, and eliminated most carbs. The starter I use has been acclimated to whole wheat and I love it. Since I eat very few carbs, the sourdough doesn't seem to affect me as much as rice, white bread, potatoes, etc. I don't get groggy, and my extremities don't swell. But I only eat a couple slices at a time and haven't measure blood sugar diligently. But I do recommend it as long as you make it at home if you crave carbs like I do. It took me five years to lose the sugar craving, and I'm really just starting to work on the carb craving. It seems more difficult since there are always carbs around in one form or another. PS- you can get 50 lbs of flour for around $15, and sourdough is easy to make, just takes some time.\nWelcome to DD. Just so you know, the last post in this thread was nearly five years ago.

Acids increase the time your food stays in your stomach. That is not nearly as helpful as fat or fiber that reduces the rate you digest your carbs. Most diabetes can only tolerate small amounts of carbs safely. Sourdough will not help a 'normal' diabetic. For the rest like me, it doesn't matter.

It was also the reason I went through the carb flu a second time - that lasted almost a week, with me literally face down in a pillow during most of that time. And the reason I finally went out and bought a glucose meter. And it knocked my weight loss efforts completely off-track. It sent my BG sky high. Probably had a good 3 month \"remission\" from my remission, if you catch my drift. Never again. That stuff might as well be Wonderbread, as far as my BG is concerned. Don't let the \"but sourdough starter is different\" talk fool you. Yes I know everyone is different, but this was the single worst mistake I ever made diet-wise on my diabetes journey, hands down.\nI absolutely love sourdough bread. I don't eat it though. The carb counts on sourdough bread are more than double the carbs per slice of any other bread. I don't eat much bread at all but when I do it's a thin slice of light bread at 8 carbs per slice. Most sourdough bread I've seen around here is 25 carbs per slice. One slice of bread would my whole meals worth of carbs.\nFor me.....sourdough bread is like taking a piece of white bread and pouring a Coke on it. I go through the roof.....Of course I love the stuff...just can't hardly eat it.\nCertainly everyone is different, but what I found interesting is the finding that the oft-recommended \"whole wheat\" bread had greater impact and over a longer period of time. It's not always sufficient to give a passing grade to something that doesn't spike you very much at two hours.\nThere are sourdough breads out there at 15 g a slice.

Acids increase the time your food stays in your stomach. That is not nearly as helpful as fat or fiber that reduces the rate you digest your carbs. Most diabetes can only tolerate small amounts of carbs safely. Sourdough will not help a 'normal' diabetic. For the rest like me, it doesn't matter.

Soon all the states will shut down bloggers for saying low carb is good.\nI think with any blog site you need to be careful to make a disclaimer about giving medical advice or treatment advice.

I don't believe any of these approaches are a cure but ways to manage your D.\nfurball64801 said: Yes I think there is a thread on this already.

While I think it's a ridiculous lawsuit and a waste of taxpayer dollars, I don't believe it's a conspiracy against a low-carb diet. A territorial pissing match? Yes, I think that fits better.\nIf he was promising cures, I'm not sure I'm against him being shut down. There is already so much misinformation out there, so if people were held accountable for it, it wouldn't be a bad thing. ETA: On his second post, he is giving what sounds like advice to ignore all dietitians, nutrionists, doctors, and the ADA. Now he is surprised that the authorities are angry? Saying basically \"ignore all medical professionals and do what I tell you\" is indeed practicing medicine without a license... I'm not crying for this guy.\nThe author of this blog went out of his way to violate state laws regarding practicing nutrition without a license. You can argue with the law and whether or not it's too strict, but publicly violating it as he has was not smart. It's perfectly fine to talk about what works for you. It's another to start telling others how to live their lives and promising results without any accreditation. Although this is an unpleasant case, it's a slippery slope if we allow anyone to practice medicine without consequence, especially in the age of self-publishing. That's my $.02 at least.\nI'm relieved to hear that this isn't the beginning of a trend to stop regular folks from sharing what works for them. I've learned more about how to live a healthy life here on this forum than I ever did from anyone in the medical field.\nNow you can write a book and say almost anything, and sell the book. I don't even think you have to have a disclaimer. What you can't do is hang out a shingle, and practice medicine and charge. There is a fairly conspicuous line between these two activities. I suspect that so long as he was only selling information, and not advising specific individuals the courts would side with him.\nRob said: Now you can write a book and say almost anything, and sell the book.

That is why they wanted to make him take down the FAQ page, where he was advising specific individuals.

Click to expand... It was a joke maybe I should have stated as much.\nI don't think this matter is a joke at all. This is just a first skirmish in a nation wide effort by dieticians to obtain a monopoly on nutritional counseling. This would mean that trainers, doctors and Phd researchers and other professionals who are fully qualified to give advice on nutrition would be \"banned\" from giving out advice. Michael Ellsberg in Forbes wrote about these efforts in a recent article .

This is food we're talking about. Last I tried it, food was essential to not just my health but my continued existence as a pot stirrer. How can you possibly justify wrapping any sort of law around what I can eat let? How can you justify telling me I can't talk about what I eat? BTW, Steve never claimed to be cured. In fact, he's blogged about experiments where he showed he wasn't cured. Read the blog sometime. Steve harshly criticizes the ADAs, big corporations of all types, and practically all health professionals. He has always had a disclaimer; though it hasn't been front and center. He has advised people as a zealous, ignorant Southern boy who had discovered his own remedy on his own and wished to share it. The incidences were few, and he no longer provides any advice or thoughts directed at individuals.

This has nothing to do with \"feeding others\". It is the \"advise people\" part that I bolded that is the problem. If people go to his house, he can feed them whatever he wants; he can also tell the entire world what he eats. But when he starts telling other individuals to eat this or that, he is practicing medicine and/or nutrition without a license.\nI think Diabetes Warrior is poking a stick at a big dog. IMHO the big dog needs to be poked about the accepted conventions concerning the treatment of diabetes. I have been to the classes and had the discussion about the fact that I can't get my BS under control eating 80 carbs a day. I also talk to many diabetics who refuse to take ownership of their illness. They are doomed to fail. Too much dependence on doctors, meds and someone else to fix it. Did I mention that they still love their cheese cake?\nFor many they think its pop a pill and eat what I want disease, the sad thing is that it is not. Without diet change and for most reduction of carbs no pill can take care of that.\nI believe a key point was also that originally the blogger was charging people for coaching on his website as well. That may be what originally tripped him up.\nEvery state has its own regulations. You seem to need a license for almost everything. If you are charging for a service the state can control what you do, unfortunately.\nYes I think there is a thread on this already. Soon all the states will shut down bloggers for saying low carb is good.\nI think with any blog site you need to be careful to make a disclaimer about giving medical advice or treatment advice.

While I think it's a ridiculous lawsuit and a waste of taxpayer dollars, I don't believe it's a conspiracy against a low-carb diet. A territorial pissing match? Yes, I think that fits better.\nIf he was promising cures, I'm not sure I'm against him being shut down. There is already so much misinformation out there, so if people were held accountable for it, it wouldn't be a bad thing.

Saying basically \"ignore all medical professionals and do what I tell you\" is indeed practicing medicine without a license... I'm not crying for this guy.\nThe author of this blog went out of his way to violate state laws regarding practicing nutrition without a license. You can argue with the law and whether or not it's too strict, but publicly violating it as he has was not smart. It's perfectly fine to talk about what works for you. It's another to start telling others how to live their lives and promising results without any accreditation. Although this is an unpleasant case, it's a slippery slope if we allow anyone to practice medicine without consequence, especially in the age of self-publishing. That's my $.02 at least.\nI'm relieved to hear that this isn't the beginning of a trend to stop regular folks from sharing what works for them. I've learned more about how to live a healthy life here on this forum than I ever did from anyone in the medical field.\nNow you can write a book and say almost anything, and sell the book. I don't even think you have to have a disclaimer. What you can't do is hang out a shingle, and practice medicine and charge. There is a fairly conspicuous line between these two activities.

This is food we're talking about. Last I tried it, food was essential to not just my health but my continued existence as a pot stirrer. How can you possibly justify wrapping any sort of law around what I can eat let? How can you justify telling me I can't talk about what I eat? BTW, Steve never claimed to be cured. In fact, he's blogged about experiments where he showed he wasn't cured. Read the blog sometime. Steve harshly criticizes the ADAs, big corporations of all types, and practically all health professionals. He has always had a disclaimer; though it hasn't been front and center. He has advised people as a zealous, ignorant Southern boy who had discovered his own remedy on his own and wished to share it. The incidences were few, and he no longer provides any advice or thoughts directed at individuals.

This has nothing to do with \"feeding others\". It is the \"advise people\" part that I bolded that is the problem. If people go to his house, he can feed them whatever he wants; he can also tell the entire world what he eats. But when he starts telling other individuals to eat this or that, he is practicing medicine and/or nutrition without a license.\nI think Diabetes Warrior is poking a stick at a big dog. IMHO the big dog needs to be poked about the accepted conventions concerning the treatment of diabetes. I have been to the classes and had the discussion about the fact that I can't get my BS under control eating 80 carbs a day. I also talk to many diabetics who refuse to take ownership of their illness. They are doomed to fail. Too much dependence on doctors, meds and someone else to fix it. Did I mention that they still love their cheese cake?\nFor many they think its pop a pill and eat what I want disease, the sad thing is that it is not. Without diet change and for most reduction of carbs no pill can take care of that.\nI believe a key point was also that originally the blogger was charging people for coaching on his website as well. That may be what originally tripped him up.\nEvery state has its own regulations. You seem to need a license for almost everything. If you are charging for a service the state can control what you do, unfortunately.\nYes I think there is a thread on this already. Soon all the states will shut down bloggers for saying low carb is good.\nI think with any blog site you need to be careful to make a disclaimer about giving medical advice or treatment advice.

While I think it's a ridiculous lawsuit and a waste of taxpayer dollars, I don't believe it's a conspiracy against a low-carb diet. A territorial pissing match? Yes, I think that fits better.\nIf he was promising cures, I'm not sure I'm against him being shut down. There is already so much misinformation out there, so if people were held accountable for it, it wouldn't be a bad thing.

Saying basically \"ignore all medical professionals and do what I tell you\" is indeed practicing medicine without a license... I'm not crying for this guy.\nThe author of this blog went out of his way to violate state laws regarding practicing nutrition without a license. You can argue with the law and whether or not it's too strict, but publicly violating it as he has was not smart. It's perfectly fine to talk about what works for you. It's another to start telling others how to live their lives and promising results without any accreditation. Although this is an unpleasant case, it's a slippery slope if we allow anyone to practice medicine without consequence, especially in the age of self-publishing. That's my $.02 at least.\nI'm relieved to hear that this isn't the beginning of a trend to stop regular folks from sharing what works for them. I've learned more about how to live a healthy life here on this forum than I ever did from anyone in the medical field.\nNow you can write a book and say almost anything, and sell the book. I don't even think you have to have a disclaimer. What you can't do is hang out a shingle, and practice medicine and charge. There is a fairly conspicuous line between these two activities.

This is food we're talking about. Last I tried it, food was essential to not just my health but my continued existence as a pot stirrer.

In fact, he's blogged about experiments where he showed he wasn't cured. Read the blog sometime. Steve harshly criticizes the ADAs, big corporations of all types, and practically all health professionals. He has always had a disclaimer; though it hasn't been front and center. He has advised people as a zealous, ignorant Southern boy who had discovered his own remedy on his own and wished to share it.

This has nothing to do with \"feeding others\". It is the \"advise people\" part that I bolded that is the problem. If people go to his house, he can feed them whatever he wants; he can also tell the entire world what he eats. But when he starts telling other individuals to eat this or that, he is practicing medicine and/or nutrition without a license.\nI think Diabetes Warrior is poking a stick at a big dog. IMHO the big dog needs to be poked about the accepted conventions concerning the treatment of diabetes. I have been to the classes and had the discussion about the fact that I can't get my BS under control eating 80 carbs a day. I also talk to many diabetics who refuse to take ownership of their illness. They are doomed to fail. Too much dependence on doctors, meds and someone else to fix it. Did I mention that they still love their cheese cake?\nFor many they think its pop a pill and eat what I want disease, the sad thing is that it is not. Without diet change and for most reduction of carbs no pill can take care of that.\nI believe a key point was also that originally the blogger was charging people for coaching on his website as well. That may be what originally tripped him up.\nEvery state has its own regulations. You seem to need a license for almost everything. If you are charging for a service the state can control what you do, unfortunately.\nYes I think there is a thread on this already. Soon all the states will shut down bloggers for saying low carb is good.\nI think with any blog site you need to be careful to make a disclaimer about giving medical advice or treatment advice. Now from what I have read he claims a cure to get off insulin. I don't believe any of these approaches are a cure but ways to manage your D.\nfurball64801 said: Yes I think there is a thread on this already.

While I think it's a ridiculous lawsuit and a waste of taxpayer dollars, I don't believe it's a conspiracy against a low-carb diet. A territorial pissing match? Yes, I think that fits better.\nIf he was promising cures, I'm not sure I'm against him being shut down. There is already so much misinformation out there, so if people were held accountable for it, it wouldn't be a bad thing. ETA: On his second post, he is giving what sounds like advice to ignore all dietitians, nutrionists, doctors, and the ADA. Now he is surprised that the authorities are angry? Saying basically \"ignore all medical professionals and do what I tell you\" is indeed practicing medicine without a license... I'm not crying for this guy.\nThe author of this blog went out of his way to violate state laws regarding practicing nutrition without a license. You can argue with the law and whether or not it's too strict, but publicly violating it as he has was not smart. It's perfectly fine to talk about what works for you. It's another to start telling others how to live their lives and promising results without any accreditation. Although this is an unpleasant case, it's a slippery slope if we allow anyone to practice medicine without consequence, especially in the age of self-publishing. That's my $.02 at least.\nI'm relieved to hear that this isn't the beginning of a trend to stop regular folks from sharing what works for them. I've learned more about how to live a healthy life here on this forum than I ever did from anyone in the medical field.\nNow you can write a book and say almost anything, and sell the book. I don't even think you have to have a disclaimer. What you can't do is hang out a shingle, and practice medicine and charge. There is a fairly conspicuous line between these two activities.

This is food we're talking about. Last I tried it, food was essential to not just my health but my continued existence as a pot stirrer. How can you possibly justify wrapping any sort of law around what I can eat let? How can you justify telling me I can't talk about what I eat? BTW, Steve never claimed to be cured. In fact, he's blogged about experiments where he showed he wasn't cured. Read the blog sometime. Steve harshly criticizes the ADAs, big corporations of all types, and practically all health professionals. He has always had a disclaimer; though it hasn't been front and center. He has advised people as a zealous, ignorant Southern boy who had discovered his own remedy on his own and wished to share it. The incidences were few, and he no longer provides any advice or thoughts directed at individuals.

This has nothing to do with \"feeding others\". It is the \"advise people\" part that I bolded that is the problem. If people go to his house, he can feed them whatever he wants; he can also tell the entire world what he eats. But when he starts telling other individuals to eat this or that, he is practicing medicine and/or nutrition without a license.\nI think Diabetes Warrior is poking a stick at a big dog. IMHO the big dog needs to be poked about the accepted conventions concerning the treatment of diabetes. I have been to the classes and had the discussion about the fact that I can't get my BS under control eating 80 carbs a day. I also talk to many diabetics who refuse to take ownership of their illness. They are doomed to fail. Too much dependence on doctors, meds and someone else to fix it. Did I mention that they still love their cheese cake?\nFor many they think its pop a pill and eat what I want disease, the sad thing is that it is not. Without diet change and for most reduction of carbs no pill can take care of that.\nI believe a key point was also that originally the blogger was charging people for coaching on his website as well. That may be what originally tripped him up.\nEvery state has its own regulations. You seem to need a license for almost everything. If you are charging for a service the state can control what you do, unfortunately.\nYes I think there is a thread on this already. Soon all the states will shut down bloggers for saying low carb is good.\nI think with any blog site you need to be careful to make a disclaimer about giving medical advice or treatment advice.

Yes, I think that fits better.\nIf he was promising cures, I'm not sure I'm against him being shut down. There is already so much misinformation out there, so if people were held accountable for it, it wouldn't be a bad thing.

Saying basically \"ignore all medical professionals and do what I tell you\" is indeed practicing medicine without a license... I'm not crying for this guy.\nThe author of this blog went out of his way to violate state laws regarding practicing nutrition without a license. You can argue with the law and whether or not it's too strict, but publicly violating it as he has was not smart. It's perfectly fine to talk about what works for you. It's another to start telling others how to live their lives and promising results without any accreditation. Although this is an unpleasant case, it's a slippery slope if we allow anyone to practice medicine without consequence, especially in the age of self-publishing. That's my $.02 at least.\nI'm relieved to hear that this isn't the beginning of a trend to stop regular folks from sharing what works for them. I've learned more about how to live a healthy life here on this forum than I ever did from anyone in the medical field.\nNow you can write a book and say almost anything, and sell the book. I don't even think you have to have a disclaimer. What you can't do is hang out a shingle, and practice medicine and charge. There is a fairly conspicuous line between these two activities.

This is food we're talking about. Last I tried it, food was essential to not just my health but my continued existence as a pot stirrer.

In fact, he's blogged about experiments where he showed he wasn't cured. Read the blog sometime. Steve harshly criticizes the ADAs, big corporations of all types, and practically all health professionals. He has always had a disclaimer; though it hasn't been front and center. He has advised people as a zealous, ignorant Southern boy who had discovered his own remedy on his own and wished to share it. The incidences were few, and he no longer provides any advice or thoughts directed at individuals.

This has nothing to do with \"feeding others\". It is the \"advise people\" part that I bolded that is the problem. If people go to his house, he can feed them whatever he wants; he can also tell the entire world what he eats. But when he starts telling other individuals to eat this or that, he is practicing medicine and/or nutrition without a license.\nI think Diabetes Warrior is poking a stick at a big dog. IMHO the big dog needs to be poked about the accepted conventions concerning the treatment of diabetes. I have been to the classes and had the discussion about the fact that I can't get my BS under control eating 80 carbs a day. I also talk to many diabetics who refuse to take ownership of their illness. They are doomed to fail. Too much dependence on doctors, meds and someone else to fix it. Did I mention that they still love their cheese cake?\nFor many they think its pop a pill and eat what I want disease, the sad thing is that it is not. Without diet change and for most reduction of carbs no pill can take care of that.\nI believe a key point was also that originally the blogger was charging people for coaching on his website as well. That may be what originally tripped him up.\nEvery state has its own regulations. You seem to need a license for almost everything. If you are charging for a service the state can control what you do, unfortunately.\nYes I think there is a thread on this already. Soon all the states will shut down bloggers for saying low carb is good.\nI think with any blog site you need to be careful to make a disclaimer about giving medical advice or treatment advice.

There is already so much misinformation out there, so if people were held accountable for it, it wouldn't be a bad thing.

Saying basically \"ignore all medical professionals and do what I tell you\" is indeed practicing medicine without a license... I'm not crying for this guy.\nThe author of this blog went out of his way to violate state laws regarding practicing nutrition without a license. You can argue with the law and whether or not it's too strict, but publicly violating it as he has was not smart. It's perfectly fine to talk about what works for you. It's another to start telling others how to live their lives and promising results without any accreditation. Although this is an unpleasant case, it's a slippery slope if we allow anyone to practice medicine without consequence, especially in the age of self-publishing. That's my $.02 at least.\nI'm relieved to hear that this isn't the beginning of a trend to stop regular folks from sharing what works for them. I've learned more about how to live a healthy life here on this forum than I ever did from anyone in the medical field.\nNow you can write a book and say almost anything, and sell the book. I don't even think you have to have a disclaimer. What you can't do is hang out a shingle, and practice medicine and charge. There is a fairly conspicuous line between these two activities.

This is food we're talking about. Last I tried it, food was essential to not just my health but my continued existence as a pot stirrer.

In fact, he's blogged about experiments where he showed he wasn't cured. Read the blog sometime. Steve harshly criticizes the ADAs, big corporations of all types, and practically all health professionals. He has always had a disclaimer; though it hasn't been front and center. He has advised people as a zealous, ignorant Southern boy who had discovered his own remedy on his own and wished to share it. The incidences were few, and he no longer provides any advice or thoughts directed at individuals.

This has nothing to do with \"feeding others\". It is the \"advise people\" part that I bolded that is the problem. If people go to his house, he can feed them whatever he wants; he can also tell the entire world what he eats. But when he starts telling other individuals to eat this or that, he is practicing medicine and/or nutrition without a license.\nI think Diabetes Warrior is poking a stick at a big dog. IMHO the big dog needs to be poked about the accepted conventions concerning the treatment of diabetes. I have been to the classes and had the discussion about the fact that I can't get my BS under control eating 80 carbs a day. I also talk to many diabetics who refuse to take ownership of their illness. They are doomed to fail. Too much dependence on doctors, meds and someone else to fix it. Did I mention that they still love their cheese cake?\nFor many they think its pop a pill and eat what I want disease, the sad thing is that it is not. Without diet change and for most reduction of carbs no pill can take care of that.\nI believe a key point was also that originally the blogger was charging people for coaching on his website as well. That may be what originally tripped him up.\nEvery state has its own regulations. You seem to need a license for almost everything. If you are charging for a service the state can control what you do, unfortunately.\nYes I think there is a thread on this already. Soon all the states will shut down bloggers for saying low carb is good.\nI think with any blog site you need to be careful to make a disclaimer about giving medical advice or treatment advice.

While I think it's a ridiculous lawsuit and a waste of taxpayer dollars, I don't believe it's a conspiracy against a low-carb diet. A territorial pissing match? Yes, I think that fits better.\nIf he was promising cures, I'm not sure I'm against him being shut down. There is already so much misinformation out there, so if people were held accountable for it, it wouldn't be a bad thing.

Saying basically \"ignore all medical professionals and do what I tell you\" is indeed practicing medicine without a license... I'm not crying for this guy.\nThe author of this blog went out of his way to violate state laws regarding practicing nutrition without a license. You can argue with the law and whether or not it's too strict, but publicly violating it as he has was not smart. It's perfectly fine to talk about what works for you. It's another to start telling others how to live their lives and promising results without any accreditation. Although this is an unpleasant case, it's a slippery slope if we allow anyone to practice medicine without consequence, especially in the age of self-publishing. That's my $.02 at least.\nI'm relieved to hear that this isn't the beginning of a trend to stop regular folks from sharing what works for them. I've learned more about how to live a healthy life here on this forum than I ever did from anyone in the medical field.\nNow you can write a book and say almost anything, and sell the book. I don't even think you have to have a disclaimer. What you can't do is hang out a shingle, and practice medicine and charge. There is a fairly conspicuous line between these two activities.

If it's the conversation I'm thinking of, there is a requirement to have a CDE lead the support group sessions if you are looking to have ADA accreditation . I don't have any problem with that, and think it's perfectly reasonable for an organization to have minimum standards before they'll attach their name. So I think this falls into the same gray area. I guess he could put it in a book and sell it but not put it on his website. Now, I know all sorts of trainers in the gym who have minimal training in nutrition give nutritional advice to individuals. Why would this be different. Click to expand... If those trainers work in NC then they are likely liable.\nIf you've bothered to read the NC regulations as posted in the blog, you'd discover that it's illegal to feed your children, it's illegal to feed your spouse, and it's especially illegal to feed your aging diabetic parents. This is food we're talking about. Last I tried it, food was essential to not just my health but my continued existence as a pot stirrer. How can you possibly justify wrapping any sort of law around what I can eat let? How can you justify telling me I can't talk about what I eat? BTW, Steve never claimed to be cured. In fact, he's blogged about experiments where he showed he wasn't cured. Read the blog sometime. Steve harshly criticizes the ADAs, big corporations of all types, and practically all health professionals. He has always had a disclaimer; though it hasn't been front and center. He has advised people as a zealous, ignorant Southern boy who had discovered his own remedy on his own and wished to share it. The incidences were few, and he no longer provides any advice or thoughts directed at individuals. I won't even go down the first amendment path.\nCallMeMed said: If it's the conversation I'm thinking of, there is a requirement to have a CDE lead the support group sessions if you are looking to have ADA accreditation .

This has nothing to do with \"feeding others\". It is the \"advise people\" part that I bolded that is the problem. If people go to his house, he can feed them whatever he wants; he can also tell the entire world what he eats. But when he starts telling other individuals to eat this or that, he is practicing medicine and/or nutrition without a license.\nI think Diabetes Warrior is poking a stick at a big dog. IMHO the big dog needs to be poked about the accepted conventions concerning the treatment of diabetes. I have been to the classes and had the discussion about the fact that I can't get my BS under control eating 80 carbs a day. I also talk to many diabetics who refuse to take ownership of their illness. They are doomed to fail. Too much dependence on doctors, meds and someone else to fix it. Did I mention that they still love their cheese cake?\nFor many they think its pop a pill and eat what I want disease, the sad thing is that it is not. Without diet change and for most reduction of carbs no pill can take care of that.\nI believe a key point was also that originally the blogger was charging people for coaching on his website as well. That may be what originally tripped him up.\nEvery state has its own regulations. You seem to need a license for almost everything. If you are charging for a service the state can control what you do, unfortunately.\nYes I think there is a thread on this already. Soon all the states will shut down bloggers for saying low carb is good.\nI think with any blog site you need to be careful to make a disclaimer about giving medical advice or treatment advice. Now from what I have read he claims a cure to get off insulin. I don't believe any of these approaches are a cure but ways to manage your D.\nfurball64801 said: Yes I think there is a thread on this already. Soon all the states will shut down bloggers for saying low carb is good. Click to expand... C'mon Fur, this isn't about saying low carb is good. While I think it's a ridiculous lawsuit and a waste of taxpayer dollars, I don't believe it's a conspiracy against a low-carb diet. A territorial pissing match? Yes, I think that fits better.\nIf he was promising cures, I'm not sure I'm against him being shut down. There is already so much misinformation out there, so if people were held accountable for it, it wouldn't be a bad thing. ETA: On his second post, he is giving what sounds like advice to ignore all dietitians, nutrionists, doctors, and the ADA. Now he is surprised that the authorities are angry? Saying basically \"ignore all medical professionals and do what I tell you\" is indeed practicing medicine without a license... I'm not crying for this guy.\nThe author of this blog went out of his way to violate state laws regarding practicing nutrition without a license. You can argue with the law and whether or not it's too strict, but publicly violating it as he has was not smart. It's perfectly fine to talk about what works for you. It's another to start telling others how to live their lives and promising results without any accreditation. Although this is an unpleasant case, it's a slippery slope if we allow anyone to practice medicine without consequence, especially in the age of self-publishing. That's my $.02 at least.\nI'm relieved to hear that this isn't the beginning of a trend to stop regular folks from sharing what works for them. I've learned more about how to live a healthy life here on this forum than I ever did from anyone in the medical field.\nNow you can write a book and say almost anything, and sell the book. I don't even think you have to have a disclaimer. What you can't do is hang out a shingle, and practice medicine and charge. There is a fairly conspicuous line between these two activities. I suspect that so long as he was only selling information, and not advising specific individuals the courts would side with him.\nRob said: Now you can write a book and say almost anything, and sell the book.

That is why they wanted to make him take down the FAQ page, where he was advising specific individuals. They didn't ask him to take the whole site down.\nCallMeMed said: C'mon Fur, this isn't about saying low carb is good.

Click to expand... It was a joke maybe I should have stated as much.\nI don't think this matter is a joke at all. This is just a first skirmish in a nation wide effort by dieticians to obtain a monopoly on nutritional counseling. This would mean that trainers, doctors and Phd researchers and other professionals who are fully qualified to give advice on nutrition would be \"banned\" from giving out advice. Michael Ellsberg in Forbes wrote about these efforts in a recent article . It would be one thing if the science was clear about nutrition and Dieticians had a clue, but I believe that the USDA and the American Dietetic Association (I can't even bring myself to say their current name) are just outright wrong. It is just crazy to give them a stranglehold so that they can force their dietary evil on the public. We need to stand up and protect ourselves from this action. Americans have a right to alternate sources of advice and we have a right to the truth.\nbsc said: I don't think this matter is a joke at all.

Now I can get busy !\nBCG Vaccine The Start of Something Great Fascinating research. I would love to have you on our program \"Diabetes Discourse\" which airs on ReachMD XM 160. We have been discussing all kinds of new research from NICE-SUGAR to pharmacogenomics.\nWow, this makes me squeal! I was looking into the Clinical Trial going on in Miami, and had qualified for such. I was very uncomfortable with the immuno-suppressant drugs that had to be taken to recieve donor Islet cells. I'm glad I waited, this is FABULOUS NEWS!!!!! Renee\nHi David, Thanks for the updates. Please keep posting on the progress of phase 2 trial. Michael\nDear David. Does this vaccine help once the pancreas is completely toast or is it for patients that are in the very beginning of the disease with some beta cell function left?\nGood question there\nIf it works, it will work if your pancreas is completely toast. I highly recommend watching the interview linked in the first post. It explains it in great detail.\nCalgaryDiabetic said: Dear David. Does this vaccine help once the pancreas is completely toast or is it for patients that are in the very beginning of the disease with some beta cell function left? Click to expand... Here is my take on it ... It seems the pancreas keeps creating new beta cells, for many years after the initial autoimmune attack. But significant amounts of insulin are not produced because the new beta cells are promptly killed off. Eventually, the beta cell regeneration process stops. And having no GAD antibodies suggests that this has happened. In such a person, there would also be zero c-peptide. I suspect that most of us who have had T1 for 30+ years fall into this category. And the BCG treatment would not have any effect, unless if was combined with new implanted beta cells ... . Next time I see a doctor,I am going to ask for an antibody and c-peptide test. The result will tell me if my pancreas is still making beta cells. I don't know if the doctor willagree to it, though.\nThere seem to be some human clinical trials going on for drugs that regenerate or restore beta cell mass (no need for implantation). INGAP http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00995540?intr=\"INGAP-Peptide\"&rank=1 Transition Therapeutics http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00239148?term=transition+therapeutics+diabetes&rank=2 and it was bought out by Eli Lilly, and they're doing tests in T2s (makes sense since they don't have to worry about autoimmunity) Faustman's own studies implied that spleen cells can be differentiated into insulin producing cells. But this hasn't been tested in human yet, just mice.\nddant said: There seem to be some human clinical trials going on for drugs that regenerate or restore beta cell mass (no need for implantation). INGAP http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00995540?intr=\"INGAP-Peptide\"&rank=1 Click to expand... There is nothing to stop the newly produced beta cells being destroyed by the same antibodies that cause the T1 diabetes in the first place. It is only half the solution to the T1 problem. And I am wondering why T2s have been excluded from the study ... .\noh ofcourse, but I was just replying to the \"if Faustman's trials do stop the autoimmune attack but our pancreas are burnt out beyond regeneration\" scenario. The trials I mentioned are supposedly being planned as part of a 2-step treatment. One drug to stop the autoimmune attack and one drug to regenerate beta cell mass.\nI didn't read anything new from this update, it just stated what dr Faustman has been saying for far too long! At the beggining I was really excited about this research but as it goes on, with the money that dr Faustman has spend and needs -as she states- to continue I am starting to wonder. Afterall this is a cheap drug that has been used. What does she need all that money for? If it works I say treat 2-3 people see it works and then continue, I dont think that figuring out a dose needs millions!\nIts surprizing that any diabetes cure research program has made it to the 2nd phase. So many times in the past cure research has stopped at phase 1. I wonder if any pharmacutical companys are jumping to steal the information and hid it so no one else can ever find it. Good work Dr Faustman. Keep up the work. Just keep the data locked up and keep the key hidden so only your team knows where it is. Maybe then a cure will actually be released to the public in the near future.\nKaterina, clinical trials take 8 years on average to complete. So two years to complete a phase 1 trial is completely normal. The FDA does not let you test the drug on two or three people and then move on. She needs to prove that this treatment has a positive effect in limited doses over hundreds or thousands of individuals that fit a diverse set of requirements. The study needs to be double-blind and randomized. This takes time and is expensive. For an example of why this is expensive, you need only look at her lab equipment. To test if the treatment is having a positive effect on the \"bad\" t-cells, she built a machine that can sort 1 type of t-cell out of a million other blood cells. This machine costs millions of dollars and a team of engineers to build. And that's merely one small component of completing this project. To put this in perspective, if she was creating a new drug, it would cost at least $1,000,000,000 - that's one billion dollars - to get to the start of a phase 1 clinical trial. The process to bring a treatment market is expensive and time-consuming no matter how you look at it. So I would not look at the minor money involved here (well under $50,000,000) or the short time (less than 24 months to complete a phase 1 trial) and see anything but positive signs. As AlbertE said, most trials never even get to a phase II so this is actually good news all around.\nThank you for the illustration of how much effort is being expended toward a cure!\nI'm sorry but I have to dissagree phase 1 trials dont need thousands or hundreds not even phase 2 doesnt need hundreds. They need a small number of patients. Also lab work is before clinical trials when you say you are ready to move into human clinical trials you do it on humans and see if it works so far dr Faustman has not proven anything on a real person. Dont get me wrong I hope all the best for her but I think she is fooling us and maybe herself I would really love to be wrong!!\nKaterina, Dr. Faustman has already published results (see the newsletter attached to the first post). The goal of a Phase 1 trial is to achieve positive improvement in the t-cell count and she has done so. This is not \"proof\" that it works, but does mean that she has shown sufficient evidence to move onto a phase 2 trial.\nThis is really a good news...\nFaustman Fall 2009 Update Thanks David !

And I am wondering why T2s have been excluded from the study ... .\noh ofcourse, but I was just replying to the \"if Faustman's trials do stop the autoimmune attack but our pancreas are burnt out beyond regeneration\" scenario. The trials I mentioned are supposedly being planned as part of a 2-step treatment. One drug to stop the autoimmune attack and one drug to regenerate beta cell mass.\nI didn't read anything new from this update, it just stated what dr Faustman has been saying for far too long! At the beggining I was really excited about this research but as it goes on, with the money that dr Faustman has spend and needs -as she states- to continue I am starting to wonder. Afterall this is a cheap drug that has been used. What does she need all that money for? If it works I say treat 2-3 people see it works and then continue, I dont think that figuring out a dose needs millions!\nIts surprizing that any diabetes cure research program has made it to the 2nd phase. So many times in the past cure research has stopped at phase 1. I wonder if any pharmacutical companys are jumping to steal the information and hid it so no one else can ever find it. Good work Dr Faustman. Keep up the work. Just keep the data locked up and keep the key hidden so only your team knows where it is. Maybe then a cure will actually be released to the public in the near future.\nKaterina, clinical trials take 8 years on average to complete. So two years to complete a phase 1 trial is completely normal. The FDA does not let you test the drug on two or three people and then move on. She needs to prove that this treatment has a positive effect in limited doses over hundreds or thousands of individuals that fit a diverse set of requirements. The study needs to be double-blind and randomized. This takes time and is expensive. For an example of why this is expensive, you need only look at her lab equipment. To test if the treatment is having a positive effect on the \"bad\" t-cells, she built a machine that can sort 1 type of t-cell out of a million other blood cells. This machine costs millions of dollars and a team of engineers to build. And that's merely one small component of completing this project. To put this in perspective, if she was creating a new drug, it would cost at least $1,000,000,000 - that's one billion dollars - to get to the start of a phase 1 clinical trial. The process to bring a treatment market is expensive and time-consuming no matter how you look at it. So I would not look at the minor money involved here (well under $50,000,000) or the short time (less than 24 months to complete a phase 1 trial) and see anything but positive signs. As AlbertE said, most trials never even get to a phase II so this is actually good news all around.\nThank you for the illustration of how much effort is being expended toward a cure!\nI'm sorry but I have to dissagree phase 1 trials dont need thousands or hundreds not even phase 2 doesnt need hundreds. They need a small number of patients. Also lab work is before clinical trials when you say you are ready to move into human clinical trials you do it on humans and see if it works so far dr Faustman has not proven anything on a real person. Dont get me wrong I hope all the best for her but I think she is fooling us and maybe herself I would really love to be wrong!!\nKaterina, Dr. Faustman has already published results (see the newsletter attached to the first post). The goal of a Phase 1 trial is to achieve positive improvement in the t-cell count and she has done so. This is not \"proof\" that it works, but does mean that she has shown sufficient evidence to move onto a phase 2 trial.\nThis is really a good news...\nFaustman Fall 2009 Update Thanks David !

Does this vaccine help once the pancreas is completely toast or is it for patients that are in the very beginning of the disease with some beta cell function left?\nGood question there\nIf it works, it will work if your pancreas is completely toast. I highly recommend watching the interview linked in the first post. It explains it in great detail.\nCalgaryDiabetic said: Dear David. Does this vaccine help once the pancreas is completely toast or is it for patients that are in the very beginning of the disease with some beta cell function left? Click to expand... Here is my take on it ... It seems the pancreas keeps creating new beta cells, for many years after the initial autoimmune attack. But significant amounts of insulin are not produced because the new beta cells are promptly killed off. Eventually, the beta cell regeneration process stops. And having no GAD antibodies suggests that this has happened. In such a person, there would also be zero c-peptide. I suspect that most of us who have had T1 for 30+ years fall into this category. And the BCG treatment would not have any effect, unless if was combined with new implanted beta cells ... . Next time I see a doctor,I am going to ask for an antibody and c-peptide test. The result will tell me if my pancreas is still making beta cells. I don't know if the doctor willagree to it, though.\nThere seem to be some human clinical trials going on for drugs that regenerate or restore beta cell mass (no need for implantation).

There is nothing to stop the newly produced beta cells being destroyed by the same antibodies that cause the T1 diabetes in the first place. It is only half the solution to the T1 problem.

The trials I mentioned are supposedly being planned as part of a 2-step treatment. One drug to stop the autoimmune attack and one drug to regenerate beta cell mass.\nI didn't read anything new from this update, it just stated what dr Faustman has been saying for far too long! At the beggining I was really excited about this research but as it goes on, with the money that dr Faustman has spend and needs -as she states- to continue I am starting to wonder. Afterall this is a cheap drug that has been used. What does she need all that money for? If it works I say treat 2-3 people see it works and then continue, I dont think that figuring out a dose needs millions!\nIts surprizing that any diabetes cure research program has made it to the 2nd phase. So many times in the past cure research has stopped at phase 1. I wonder if any pharmacutical companys are jumping to steal the information and hid it so no one else can ever find it. Good work Dr Faustman. Keep up the work. Just keep the data locked up and keep the key hidden so only your team knows where it is. Maybe then a cure will actually be released to the public in the near future.\nKaterina, clinical trials take 8 years on average to complete. So two years to complete a phase 1 trial is completely normal. The FDA does not let you test the drug on two or three people and then move on. She needs to prove that this treatment has a positive effect in limited doses over hundreds or thousands of individuals that fit a diverse set of requirements. The study needs to be double-blind and randomized. This takes time and is expensive. For an example of why this is expensive, you need only look at her lab equipment. To test if the treatment is having a positive effect on the \"bad\" t-cells, she built a machine that can sort 1 type of t-cell out of a million other blood cells. This machine costs millions of dollars and a team of engineers to build. And that's merely one small component of completing this project. To put this in perspective, if she was creating a new drug, it would cost at least $1,000,000,000 - that's one billion dollars - to get to the start of a phase 1 clinical trial. The process to bring a treatment market is expensive and time-consuming no matter how you look at it. So I would not look at the minor money involved here (well under $50,000,000) or the short time (less than 24 months to complete a phase 1 trial) and see anything but positive signs. As AlbertE said, most trials never even get to a phase II so this is actually good news all around.\nThank you for the illustration of how much effort is being expended toward a cure!\nI'm sorry but I have to dissagree phase 1 trials dont need thousands or hundreds not even phase 2 doesnt need hundreds. They need a small number of patients. Also lab work is before clinical trials when you say you are ready to move into human clinical trials you do it on humans and see if it works so far dr Faustman has not proven anything on a real person. Dont get me wrong I hope all the best for her but I think she is fooling us and maybe herself I would really love to be wrong!!\nKaterina, Dr. Faustman has already published results (see the newsletter attached to the first post). The goal of a Phase 1 trial is to achieve positive improvement in the t-cell count and she has done so. This is not \"proof\" that it works, but does mean that she has shown sufficient evidence to move onto a phase 2 trial.\nThis is really a good news...\nFaustman Fall 2009 Update Thanks David !

Does this vaccine help once the pancreas is completely toast or is it for patients that are in the very beginning of the disease with some beta cell function left? Click to expand... Here is my take on it ... It seems the pancreas keeps creating new beta cells, for many years after the initial autoimmune attack. But significant amounts of insulin are not produced because the new beta cells are promptly killed off. Eventually, the beta cell regeneration process stops. And having no GAD antibodies suggests that this has happened. In such a person, there would also be zero c-peptide. I suspect that most of us who have had T1 for 30+ years fall into this category.

Does this vaccine help once the pancreas is completely toast or is it for patients that are in the very beginning of the disease with some beta cell function left?\nGood question there\nIf it works, it will work if your pancreas is completely toast. I highly recommend watching the interview linked in the first post. It explains it in great detail.\nCalgaryDiabetic said: Dear David. Does this vaccine help once the pancreas is completely toast or is it for patients that are in the very beginning of the disease with some beta cell function left? Click to expand... Here is my take on it ... It seems the pancreas keeps creating new beta cells, for many years after the initial autoimmune attack. But significant amounts of insulin are not produced because the new beta cells are promptly killed off. Eventually, the beta cell regeneration process stops. And having no GAD antibodies suggests that this has happened. In such a person, there would also be zero c-peptide. I suspect that most of us who have had T1 for 30+ years fall into this category. And the BCG treatment would not have any effect, unless if was combined with new implanted beta cells ... . Next time I see a doctor,I am going to ask for an antibody and c-peptide test. The result will tell me if my pancreas is still making beta cells. I don't know if the doctor willagree to it, though.\nThere seem to be some human clinical trials going on for drugs that regenerate or restore beta cell mass (no need for implantation). INGAP http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00995540?intr=\"INGAP-Peptide\"&rank=1 Transition Therapeutics http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00239148?term=transition+therapeutics+diabetes&rank=2 and it was bought out by Eli Lilly, and they're doing tests in T2s (makes sense since they don't have to worry about autoimmunity) Faustman's own studies implied that spleen cells can be differentiated into insulin producing cells. But this hasn't been tested in human yet, just mice.\nddant said: There seem to be some human clinical trials going on for drugs that regenerate or restore beta cell mass (no need for implantation). INGAP http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00995540?intr=\"INGAP-Peptide\"&rank=1 Click to expand... There is nothing to stop the newly produced beta cells being destroyed by the same antibodies that cause the T1 diabetes in the first place. It is only half the solution to the T1 problem. And I am wondering why T2s have been excluded from the study ... .\noh ofcourse, but I was just replying to the \"if Faustman's trials do stop the autoimmune attack but our pancreas are burnt out beyond regeneration\" scenario. The trials I mentioned are supposedly being planned as part of a 2-step treatment. One drug to stop the autoimmune attack and one drug to regenerate beta cell mass.\nI didn't read anything new from this update, it just stated what dr Faustman has been saying for far too long! At the beggining I was really excited about this research but as it goes on, with the money that dr Faustman has spend and needs -as she states- to continue I am starting to wonder. Afterall this is a cheap drug that has been used. What does she need all that money for? If it works I say treat 2-3 people see it works and then continue, I dont think that figuring out a dose needs millions!\nIts surprizing that any diabetes cure research program has made it to the 2nd phase. So many times in the past cure research has stopped at phase 1. I wonder if any pharmacutical companys are jumping to steal the information and hid it so no one else can ever find it. Good work Dr Faustman. Keep up the work. Just keep the data locked up and keep the key hidden so only your team knows where it is. Maybe then a cure will actually be released to the public in the near future.\nKaterina, clinical trials take 8 years on average to complete. So two years to complete a phase 1 trial is completely normal. The FDA does not let you test the drug on two or three people and then move on. She needs to prove that this treatment has a positive effect in limited doses over hundreds or thousands of individuals that fit a diverse set of requirements. The study needs to be double-blind and randomized. This takes time and is expensive. For an example of why this is expensive, you need only look at her lab equipment. To test if the treatment is having a positive effect on the \"bad\" t-cells, she built a machine that can sort 1 type of t-cell out of a million other blood cells. This machine costs millions of dollars and a team of engineers to build. And that's merely one small component of completing this project. To put this in perspective, if she was creating a new drug, it would cost at least $1,000,000,000 - that's one billion dollars - to get to the start of a phase 1 clinical trial. The process to bring a treatment market is expensive and time-consuming no matter how you look at it. So I would not look at the minor money involved here (well under $50,000,000) or the short time (less than 24 months to complete a phase 1 trial) and see anything but positive signs. As AlbertE said, most trials never even get to a phase II so this is actually good news all around.\nThank you for the illustration of how much effort is being expended toward a cure!\nI'm sorry but I have to dissagree phase 1 trials dont need thousands or hundreds not even phase 2 doesnt need hundreds. They need a small number of patients. Also lab work is before clinical trials when you say you are ready to move into human clinical trials you do it on humans and see if it works so far dr Faustman has not proven anything on a real person. Dont get me wrong I hope all the best for her but I think she is fooling us and maybe herself I would really love to be wrong!!\nKaterina, Dr. Faustman has already published results (see the newsletter attached to the first post). The goal of a Phase 1 trial is to achieve positive improvement in the t-cell count and she has done so. This is not \"proof\" that it works, but does mean that she has shown sufficient evidence to move onto a phase 2 trial.\nThis is really a good news...\nFaustman Fall 2009 Update Thanks David !

Does this vaccine help once the pancreas is completely toast or is it for patients that are in the very beginning of the disease with some beta cell function left?\nGood question there\nIf it works, it will work if your pancreas is completely toast. I highly recommend watching the interview linked in the first post. It explains it in great detail.\nCalgaryDiabetic said: Dear David. Does this vaccine help once the pancreas is completely toast or is it for patients that are in the very beginning of the disease with some beta cell function left? Click to expand... Here is my take on it ... It seems the pancreas keeps creating new beta cells, for many years after the initial autoimmune attack. But significant amounts of insulin are not produced because the new beta cells are promptly killed off. Eventually, the beta cell regeneration process stops. And having no GAD antibodies suggests that this has happened. In such a person, there would also be zero c-peptide. I suspect that most of us who have had T1 for 30+ years fall into this category. And the BCG treatment would not have any effect, unless if was combined with new implanted beta cells ... . Next time I see a doctor,I am going to ask for an antibody and c-peptide test. The result will tell me if my pancreas is still making beta cells. I don't know if the doctor willagree to it, though.\nThere seem to be some human clinical trials going on for drugs that regenerate or restore beta cell mass (no need for implantation). INGAP http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00995540?intr=\"INGAP-Peptide\"&rank=1 Transition Therapeutics http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00239148?term=transition+therapeutics+diabetes&rank=2 and it was bought out by Eli Lilly, and they're doing tests in T2s (makes sense since they don't have to worry about autoimmunity) Faustman's own studies implied that spleen cells can be differentiated into insulin producing cells. But this hasn't been tested in human yet, just mice.\nddant said: There seem to be some human clinical trials going on for drugs that regenerate or restore beta cell mass (no need for implantation). INGAP http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00995540?intr=\"INGAP-Peptide\"&rank=1 Click to expand... There is nothing to stop the newly produced beta cells being destroyed by the same antibodies that cause the T1 diabetes in the first place. It is only half the solution to the T1 problem. And I am wondering why T2s have been excluded from the study ... .\noh ofcourse, but I was just replying to the \"if Faustman's trials do stop the autoimmune attack but our pancreas are burnt out beyond regeneration\" scenario. The trials I mentioned are supposedly being planned as part of a 2-step treatment. One drug to stop the autoimmune attack and one drug to regenerate beta cell mass.\nI didn't read anything new from this update, it just stated what dr Faustman has been saying for far too long! At the beggining I was really excited about this research but as it goes on, with the money that dr Faustman has spend and needs -as she states- to continue I am starting to wonder. Afterall this is a cheap drug that has been used. What does she need all that money for? If it works I say treat 2-3 people see it works and then continue, I dont think that figuring out a dose needs millions!\nIts surprizing that any diabetes cure research program has made it to the 2nd phase. So many times in the past cure research has stopped at phase 1. I wonder if any pharmacutical companys are jumping to steal the information and hid it so no one else can ever find it. Good work Dr Faustman. Keep up the work. Just keep the data locked up and keep the key hidden so only your team knows where it is. Maybe then a cure will actually be released to the public in the near future.\nKaterina, clinical trials take 8 years on average to complete. So two years to complete a phase 1 trial is completely normal. The FDA does not let you test the drug on two or three people and then move on. She needs to prove that this treatment has a positive effect in limited doses over hundreds or thousands of individuals that fit a diverse set of requirements. The study needs to be double-blind and randomized. This takes time and is expensive. For an example of why this is expensive, you need only look at her lab equipment. To test if the treatment is having a positive effect on the \"bad\" t-cells, she built a machine that can sort 1 type of t-cell out of a million other blood cells. This machine costs millions of dollars and a team of engineers to build. And that's merely one small component of completing this project. To put this in perspective, if she was creating a new drug, it would cost at least $1,000,000,000 - that's one billion dollars - to get to the start of a phase 1 clinical trial. The process to bring a treatment market is expensive and time-consuming no matter how you look at it. So I would not look at the minor money involved here (well under $50,000,000) or the short time (less than 24 months to complete a phase 1 trial) and see anything but positive signs. As AlbertE said, most trials never even get to a phase II so this is actually good news all around.\nThank you for the illustration of how much effort is being expended toward a cure!\nI'm sorry but I have to dissagree phase 1 trials dont need thousands or hundreds not even phase 2 doesnt need hundreds. They need a small number of patients.

    "text": "Yikes, this is certainly some intriguing news, as being able to put a stop to the immune attack would go a long way to helping us find a cure for this disease. Still, I'll keep my excitement in check for now until the results from clinical trials are released, and some of the regulatory hurdles are eliminated ( such as the extreme expense mentioned in the article). Nonetheless, a very hopeful find.\nhmmm. well at least they are saying 3 yrs instead of 5.(has someone been reading what we say?) now im not impressed at all simply for very selfish reasons \"It is hoped that in patients newly diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, the treatment will prevent the disease developing because it will stop the destruction of vital cells of the pancreas \" im not any where near being newly dx. and its still pretty much theory, just like every other \"cure\".\nThere used to be a belief that once your beta cells are gone, they are gone for good. But it's now believed that the body continues making beta cells and just kills them off so quickly that you rarely see signs of them. Under this latter (and more likely) scenario, turning off the autoimmune response would cause your beta cells to regenerate. Even if this were not the case, it would allow you to implant beta cells generated from your own stem cells. So any way that you look at it, this would be a big piece of a biological cure. It's early stage, but each new avenue opens up some opportunities for real advances in treatments.\nthats all well and good if it proves to be true. i would be happy to not see anymore t1 babies kids teens or young adults. lol i hate to disagree with you david but i have seen so many avenues opened i could start a city. they are betting that taking a different kind of shot for possibly 2 yrs will allow the pancreas to produce its own insulin again? \"\u201cThere is evidence to suggest that using the drug over a period of time, maybe a couple of years, will allow the pancreas to recover enough to make more insulin. \" how much more insulin? im guessing enough to make people non d. and then a person just stops taking the other drug? huh.because the pancreas is working again. i dont know my pancreas has been doing nothing for 40 yrs.its just going to start working again? as it stands this is really only for new type 1 s. so this is a bit of a stretch. \"DIABETICS have been offered new hope as scientists test a drug that could save them from a lifetime of injections.\" i hope it works for the kids. but something is already messing with my autoimmune system and im in no way comfortable letting something else mess with it. i would hate to think that they could and might just screw it up so much we become the 'boy in the bubble.\" the article is confusing in a few places. insulin is being blamed now for the various things that happen to people? i am reminded every day here and elsewhere that its the high bg.\nThanks David for this. There is no information about what sort of drug is being trialled here yet it is immediately a burning question in my mind. It would be great to hear some great news in due course but until then I will not keep my hopes up too high. It's just what experience has taught me to do\nthis would be wonderful keep us posted Linda in Florida\n@ Lady Lazarus: It's about DiaPep277 made by Andromeda Biotech in Israel, I was sent a newspaper clipping in 2001, about this company and the drug and the article stated it would be on the market in 2004 (seems the Israeli don't adhere to \"the cure in 5 years\" theory....) It's still not on the market, it's still being tested, and I just read that the Diamyd phase III trials have been stopped (Diamyd is similar to Diapep277). Me too, I would love for kids and babies to have the opportunity to halt/stop the onset, but having 21 years of D under my belt, I just don't believe there's a cure, until there is one.... Sure it gives you some hope that people think they can cure D, I would be really all for that, and after speaking with a lead researcher (who's very critical about a cure coming in the next umpteen years) who had the opportunity to learn from two people with D who donated their pancreas after their death, they basically discovered that these type 1's still had some way of making new beta cells under attack, I think it might happen. But I'm not going to live my life accordingly...\ndanixxxx said: @ Lady Lazarus: It's about DiaPep277 made by Andromeda Biotech in Israel, I was sent a newspaper clipping in 2001, about this company and the drug and the article stated it would be on the market in 2004 (seems the Israeli don't adhere to \"the cure in 5 years\" theory....)

I wonder if the beta cells that are being renewed in the pancreas of a T1 are in fact those in some initial quota of 'spared beta cells' that survived the autoimmune attack. I wish there was more information about this research. When I was diagnosed, the spiel was that all the beta cells are dead, buried & gone forever. That theory seems to have now changed.\nit seems that insulin (shot/pump) has minor side affects i wonder what the side affects of a chemical such as Diamyd or Diapep277 when taken for a prolonged period will do to your body. Many avenues were opened in the last 5 decades and most of them got a \"Dead End\" sign. What about introducing stem cell generated Langehaus cells via injection and then take pills to keep them from being rejected great news a couple of years ago but where is it now??? and so on and so on. There is a great new product out on the market called Animas Vibe (a Dexcom CGM and Animas pump in one) but not available here in the US because the FDA can't get off their a@*. Must be really bad for all those people in Europe that use this device currently. NOT. Bottom line don't hold you breath or stop taking insulin because we won't see a solution soon. It is great though that scientist are working on it and hopefully our next generation can take advantage of it.\nIsn't there something in \"Diabetes Rising\" about vitamin D being able to ward off Type to some extent in kids at risk for it, and there is a vaque mention of possibly extening the Honymoon Period. I can't remember the Dr's names that did the research, it was two brothers I think. Just sounds similar to me - without the cell regeneration part.

Click to expand... There has been an enormous amount of progress with implanted beta cells protected by immunosuppressant drugs. One approach is encapsulating the cells in a protective layer and then giving localized immunosuppressant drugs right at the site of the transplant. Beta cells also crave oxygen, so there has been engineering work to create chemical reactions that can produce oxygen for 30 days while the beta cells attach to the vascular system. This approach means that you experience no side effects from the drugs (the doses are minuscule compared to taking a full body dose). Other approaches are using stem cells to culture beta cells that don't need immunosuppressants and encapsulating those to save them from the autoimmune response. Both of these approaches are working in animal models and headings towards human trials. This stuff is miles ahead of where it was 5 years ago.\nTulsaDan said: Isn't there something in \"Diabetes Rising\" about vitamin D being able to ward off Type to some extent in kids at risk for it, and there is a vaque mention of possibly extening the Honymoon Period.

The prevalence of diabetes is higher in areas with less sun. And some widespread studies have shown that kids receiving vitamin d supplements are less likely to get it. But once someone has it, I haven't seen any major studies suggesting that vitamin D will help (other than warding off depression, of course).\nDavid I just read an article put out by reflex media ( www.reflex-media.net ) in a what looks like insert of a news paper in the Netherlands. They are talking about the promising results in a study by an immunologist Dr. Bart Roep of the Leiden University where they take 2 dl (200cc, 7 fl.oz.) of your own blood and infuse/work on the immune cells with Vitamin D3 and a anti-bio-tic. After this is done the blood is re-introduced in your body and based on how many beta cells you still have it will start to generate more and stronger beta cells keeping the immune system at bay. This is again as stated B-4 great for newly discovered and young diabetics but won't work for people with 40 plus years of Type 1 and no more Beta cells.\nI sometimes forget that Vitamin D can alter the chances of you getting type 1.

Click to expand... There was a US Navy epidemiologist that made a good case about the lack of adequate vit D causing greater susceptibility to diabetes much of it using accurate Finnish data. As always we don't know if he cherry picked the data. Also this is a correlation that is the equivalent of circumstantial evidence in criminal law. I my personal case it is possible. Vit D was a big deal in Canada in the 1950 and 1960 then every one forgot about it. Milk was slightly fortified. Not sure that in Northern latitudes we can stores enough for the gloomy months. Fish except for salmon and cod livers does not contain that much. So possible but how knows ?\nCalgaryDiabetic said: There was a US Navy epidemiologist that made a good case about the lack of adequate vit D causing greater susceptibility to diabetes much of it using accurate Finnish data.

One approach is encapsulating the cells in a protective layer and then giving localized immunosuppressant drugs right at the site of the transplant. Beta cells also crave oxygen, so there has been engineering work to create chemical reactions that can produce oxygen for 30 days while the beta cells attach to the vascular system. This approach means that you experience no side effects from the drugs (the doses are minuscule compared to taking a full body dose). Other approaches are using stem cells to culture beta cells that don't need immunosuppressants and encapsulating those to save them from the autoimmune response. Both of these approaches are working in animal models and headings towards human trials.

The prevalence of diabetes is higher in areas with less sun. And some widespread studies have shown that kids receiving vitamin d supplements are less likely to get it.

After this is done the blood is re-introduced in your body and based on how many beta cells you still have it will start to generate more and stronger beta cells keeping the immune system at bay.

Click to expand... There has been an enormous amount of progress with implanted beta cells protected by immunosuppressant drugs. One approach is encapsulating the cells in a protective layer and then giving localized immunosuppressant drugs right at the site of the transplant. Beta cells also crave oxygen, so there has been engineering work to create chemical reactions that can produce oxygen for 30 days while the beta cells attach to the vascular system. This approach means that you experience no side effects from the drugs (the doses are minuscule compared to taking a full body dose). Other approaches are using stem cells to culture beta cells that don't need immunosuppressants and encapsulating those to save them from the autoimmune response. Both of these approaches are working in animal models and headings towards human trials.

The prevalence of diabetes is higher in areas with less sun. And some widespread studies have shown that kids receiving vitamin d supplements are less likely to get it.

After this is done the blood is re-introduced in your body and based on how many beta cells you still have it will start to generate more and stronger beta cells keeping the immune system at bay.

Click to expand... There has been an enormous amount of progress with implanted beta cells protected by immunosuppressant drugs. One approach is encapsulating the cells in a protective layer and then giving localized immunosuppressant drugs right at the site of the transplant. Beta cells also crave oxygen, so there has been engineering work to create chemical reactions that can produce oxygen for 30 days while the beta cells attach to the vascular system. This approach means that you experience no side effects from the drugs (the doses are minuscule compared to taking a full body dose). Other approaches are using stem cells to culture beta cells that don't need immunosuppressants and encapsulating those to save them from the autoimmune response. Both of these approaches are working in animal models and headings towards human trials.

The prevalence of diabetes is higher in areas with less sun. And some widespread studies have shown that kids receiving vitamin d supplements are less likely to get it.

After this is done the blood is re-introduced in your body and based on how many beta cells you still have it will start to generate more and stronger beta cells keeping the immune system at bay.

Click to expand... There has been an enormous amount of progress with implanted beta cells protected by immunosuppressant drugs. One approach is encapsulating the cells in a protective layer and then giving localized immunosuppressant drugs right at the site of the transplant. Beta cells also crave oxygen, so there has been engineering work to create chemical reactions that can produce oxygen for 30 days while the beta cells attach to the vascular system. This approach means that you experience no side effects from the drugs (the doses are minuscule compared to taking a full body dose). Other approaches are using stem cells to culture beta cells that don't need immunosuppressants and encapsulating those to save them from the autoimmune response. Both of these approaches are working in animal models and headings towards human trials.

The prevalence of diabetes is higher in areas with less sun. And some widespread studies have shown that kids receiving vitamin d supplements are less likely to get it.

After this is done the blood is re-introduced in your body and based on how many beta cells you still have it will start to generate more and stronger beta cells keeping the immune system at bay.

Click to expand... There has been an enormous amount of progress with implanted beta cells protected by immunosuppressant drugs. One approach is encapsulating the cells in a protective layer and then giving localized immunosuppressant drugs right at the site of the transplant. Beta cells also crave oxygen, so there has been engineering work to create chemical reactions that can produce oxygen for 30 days while the beta cells attach to the vascular system. This approach means that you experience no side effects from the drugs (the doses are minuscule compared to taking a full body dose). Other approaches are using stem cells to culture beta cells that don't need immunosuppressants and encapsulating those to save them from the autoimmune response. Both of these approaches are working in animal models and headings towards human trials.

The prevalence of diabetes is higher in areas with less sun. And some widespread studies have shown that kids receiving vitamin d supplements are less likely to get it. But once someone has it, I haven't seen any major studies suggesting that vitamin D will help (other than warding off depression, of course).\nDavid I just read an article put out by reflex media ( www.reflex-media.net ) in a what looks like insert of a news paper in the Netherlands. They are talking about the promising results in a study by an immunologist Dr. Bart Roep of the Leiden University where they take 2 dl (200cc, 7 fl.oz.) of your own blood and infuse/work on the immune cells with Vitamin D3 and a anti-bio-tic. After this is done the blood is re-introduced in your body and based on how many beta cells you still have it will start to generate more and stronger beta cells keeping the immune system at bay. This is again as stated B-4 great for newly discovered and young diabetics but won't work for people with 40 plus years of Type 1 and no more Beta cells.\nI sometimes forget that Vitamin D can alter the chances of you getting type 1.

For instance, I know the US discovered that when it stationed soldiers with very dark complexions in Alaska, they got incredibly sick do to the months of darkness at a time ( more melanin=more sunlight needed to stay healthy). Actually, come to think of it, I should find that bit of research and post it here... But anyhow, as I said, things like that make me think our connection to the Sun is significantly more important than we think.\nI don't think any study says lack of Vitamin D causes diabetes. It just dramatically increases the chances of it. The evidence for this is very strong. A sunshine map of the world correlates strongly with incidence of diabetes. A large scale study where 5,000 kids had Vitamin D supplements and 5,000 did not had zero instance of type 1 diabetes in the supplement group compared to the expected 10 to 15 people who should have. I will try to track down this study. It was in Norway, the Netherlends, or somewhere else around there. Very fascinating stuff.\nYikes, this is certainly some intriguing news, as being able to put a stop to the immune attack would go a long way to helping us find a cure for this disease. Still, I'll keep my excitement in check for now until the results from clinical trials are released, and some of the regulatory hurdles are eliminated ( such as the extreme expense mentioned in the article). Nonetheless, a very hopeful find.\nhmmm. well at least they are saying 3 yrs instead of 5.(has someone been reading what we say?) now im not impressed at all simply for very selfish reasons \"It is hoped that in patients newly diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, the treatment will prevent the disease developing because it will stop the destruction of vital cells of the pancreas \" im not any where near being newly dx. and its still pretty much theory, just like every other \"cure\".\nThere used to be a belief that once your beta cells are gone, they are gone for good. But it's now believed that the body continues making beta cells and just kills them off so quickly that you rarely see signs of them. Under this latter (and more likely) scenario, turning off the autoimmune response would cause your beta cells to regenerate. Even if this were not the case, it would allow you to implant beta cells generated from your own stem cells. So any way that you look at it, this would be a big piece of a biological cure. It's early stage, but each new avenue opens up some opportunities for real advances in treatments.\nthats all well and good if it proves to be true. i would be happy to not see anymore t1 babies kids teens or young adults. lol i hate to disagree with you david but i have seen so many avenues opened i could start a city. they are betting that taking a different kind of shot for possibly 2 yrs will allow the pancreas to produce its own insulin again? \"\u201cThere is evidence to suggest that using the drug over a period of time, maybe a couple of years, will allow the pancreas to recover enough to make more insulin. \" how much more insulin? im guessing enough to make people non d. and then a person just stops taking the other drug? huh.because the pancreas is working again. i dont know my pancreas has been doing nothing for 40 yrs.its just going to start working again? as it stands this is really only for new type 1 s. so this is a bit of a stretch. \"DIABETICS have been offered new hope as scientists test a drug that could save them from a lifetime of injections.\" i hope it works for the kids. but something is already messing with my autoimmune system and im in no way comfortable letting something else mess with it. i would hate to think that they could and might just screw it up so much we become the 'boy in the bubble.\" the article is confusing in a few places. insulin is being blamed now for the various things that happen to people? i am reminded every day here and elsewhere that its the high bg.\nThanks David for this. There is no information about what sort of drug is being trialled here yet it is immediately a burning question in my mind. It would be great to hear some great news in due course but until then I will not keep my hopes up too high.

Click to expand... It is my understanding that a LC/HF diet improves your lipid numbers, but I'm not 100% on that. Maybe some others can chime in that have issues with lipids and they can share how they lowered their numbers. I've never had a problem with my lipid numbers before or after dx, but I do think that is a strong genetic component. I've known some people who eat very healthy and they exercise like crazy and they still have high cholesterol.\nI was only on statins for 15 months and my bgs were higher, especially towards the last few months when I had a lot of joint and muscle pain. I think like a lot of other drugs statins may cause inflammation and it is the inflammation that caused my higher bgs. But doesn't inflammation also cause heart disease? So I really don't think how they can see there is any benefit . A lot of us use a LC/HF diet to manage cholesterol. It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy. Dr William Davis a cardiologist and author of Wheat Belly has a specific diet for promoting heart health. He believes in Low Carb and moderate fat. Dr Michael Eades also has a blog that pushes LC for heart health. Little by little doctors are coming around that the important number is your HDL number. Get it as high as possible and that will improve overall health.\napril said: ... I stopped taking mine, and after 3 days that ache all over feeling went. I was wondering if there was something I could take to lower my cholestrol, as low fat diets don't change much. Any advice? Click to expand... My advice is don't worry about it. Your cholesterol level is what it is. Your liver decides how much cholesterol it needs to make. It it understands your body's cholesterol needs really well. So don't second guess it.\nI'm not worried about it, but my Dr sure is. It was at it's highest 6 I remember, and she said 4 or below is what she wants a diabetic to have. Is it not dangerous then walking around with a high cholesterol count?\napril said: ... Is it not dangerous then walking around with a high cholesterol count? Click to expand... Mmmm ... maybe it is. You could be run over by a bus. But seriously, nearly half the heart attacks happen to people with low or normal cholesterol. So it seems that walking around with low or normal cholesterol is almost as dangerous as walking around with high cholesterol.\napril said: I'm not worried about it, but my Dr sure is.

I share your concerns & agree with you that if the docs are worried about it, then so should we. I know there is a strong opinion on internet sites that cholesterol doesn't matter & that we should ignore medical advice on this but I don't buy that anymore. The liver may want to produce high LDL cholesterol, but that doesn't mean it may be a healthy thing. (I have high LDL, everything else is good). I agree that statins may be quite inadequate for the task. I am currently investigating alternative approaches that have, so far, reduced my LDL levels, eg high quality fish oils.\napril said: I'm not worried about it, but my Dr sure is.

If you raise your HDL it will shut the doctor up ;-) Start to take coconut oil, if dont already, and your hdl will jump. When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl. That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones. A high LDL and a low HDL do matter. Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem. LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog. LDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident. Everytime there is an accident they show up to help. Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem. The only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects. Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins? In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women! Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run. Ditto for people over 65. No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner. Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins! So the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better. Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see. By the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion. Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run. I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up.... well you get the picture. ....\nIf the observation that 50% of cardiac problems happen to those with normal or low LDL, and the other 50% happens to those with high LDL does not set off alarms in your brain, will anything? The best evidence seems to suggest that statins do some good, but not by lowering LDL. They are also an antioxident. I tolerated them until my dr quack quack doubled my dose. After dropping statins and aforementioned dr, cholesterol went up about a 100 points to almost 270. Over the next years it settled back to less than 200. HDL was always good, and trig. went down after starting fish oil (Carlson's)\nI think the medical community has done a real good job scaring us as patients into the danger of cholesterol. Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad. Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up. Do statins work in a small amount of people probably. But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time. Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation. I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart. I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins. I now take it to repair the damage. After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly. Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins. A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic. She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors. So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease. Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg. She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't. If you get heart disease it means there is some type of inflammation going on in your body. One of the biggest forms of inflammation comes from high glycation from eating too many carbs.\nMy husband has had good results with time-release Niacin.\nWhat came to my mind when I read the article was my 2nd appt. with my FORMER Endo (also a Dr. Quack Quack) when he TRIED to prescribe a statin drug. When I pointed out to him that my lipids are NORMAL, and specifically that my Cholesterol is 177 (normal is <200), he told me I need to IGNORE the normal ranges listed on my lab results because \"they\" now say that Cholesterol needs to be <100. I didn't believe him and told him that I will not take any statins. He wasn't happy with me, but I wasn't going to allow him to sway me. I shudder to think that Dr. Quack Quack was ACTUALLY going to give me medication to MAKE my Diabetes WORSE. So, glad that I dodged that bullet.\nRob said: They are also an antioxident.

Yes they are, but I can take other antioxidants much cheaper and with no side effdects that one gets with statins. There are multiiple research paers saying this. Who paid for that research??? Hmmmm here is one such paper http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15238821 Again, NO woman should be on a statin drug. They have never been shown in any research to provide help in women and they HAVE been sown to increase all cause mortality in women! Hey Ladies, research shows this stuff will kill you!!! Dont be pressured into taking poison just to please a doctor who has been misinformed by some drug rep! And if I have determined it is a poison I cerainly wont let let my DH take it!\nGosh, I didn't know my doctor, neurologist and cardiologist were such liars!\nDoctors are generally well meaning and sincere. They just tend to be too trusting and surprisingly gullible. Perhaps it is because they don't actually suffer from the disease we have to deal with every day.\nStatins are also an anti-inflammatory. Those of us who have had heart problems tend to believe those \"quack\" cardiologists, at least until the next heart scan or some proof that all we've been doing has been beneficial. When I take my walks, I still take aspirin & nitro with me just in case, I don't know how long it takes before you forget that a major organ had a failure, but I can't bend over to pull a weed or plant a plant, without remembering that was the same movement I was making when I had my MI. I know all of the research re statins, anyone who has had any heart issues surely knows, but maybe it is one of those \"until you walk in my shoes\" type things, hard to know what you would really do. Sorry for the rant, but I get so weary of the remarks that I am doing what is wrong, when I am just trying to get my life back to normal.\nSeagul, If I were in your shoes, I would do exactly what you are doing and have the exact same opinions. But, my Doc was trying to get me to go on a statin whenever I had NO documented, medical need for it. Big difference.\nBut they approved the drug which is not proven to provide much, if any help.

Click to expand... It is my understanding that a LC/HF diet improves your lipid numbers, but I'm not 100% on that. Maybe some others can chime in that have issues with lipids and they can share how they lowered their numbers. I've never had a problem with my lipid numbers before or after dx, but I do think that is a strong genetic component. I've known some people who eat very healthy and they exercise like crazy and they still have high cholesterol.\nI was only on statins for 15 months and my bgs were higher, especially towards the last few months when I had a lot of joint and muscle pain. I think like a lot of other drugs statins may cause inflammation and it is the inflammation that caused my higher bgs. But doesn't inflammation also cause heart disease? So I really don't think how they can see there is any benefit . A lot of us use a LC/HF diet to manage cholesterol. It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy. Dr William Davis a cardiologist and author of Wheat Belly has a specific diet for promoting heart health. He believes in Low Carb and moderate fat. Dr Michael Eades also has a blog that pushes LC for heart health. Little by little doctors are coming around that the important number is your HDL number. Get it as high as possible and that will improve overall health.\napril said: ... I stopped taking mine, and after 3 days that ache all over feeling went.

Your cholesterol level is what it is. Your liver decides how much cholesterol it needs to make. It it understands your body's cholesterol needs really well. So don't second guess it.\nI'm not worried about it, but my Dr sure is. It was at it's highest 6 I remember, and she said 4 or below is what she wants a diabetic to have. Is it not dangerous then walking around with a high cholesterol count?\napril said: ... Is it not dangerous then walking around with a high cholesterol count? Click to expand... Mmmm ... maybe it is. You could be run over by a bus. But seriously, nearly half the heart attacks happen to people with low or normal cholesterol. So it seems that walking around with low or normal cholesterol is almost as dangerous as walking around with high cholesterol.\napril said: I'm not worried about it, but my Dr sure is.

I share your concerns & agree with you that if the docs are worried about it, then so should we. I know there is a strong opinion on internet sites that cholesterol doesn't matter & that we should ignore medical advice on this but I don't buy that anymore. The liver may want to produce high LDL cholesterol, but that doesn't mean it may be a healthy thing. (I have high LDL, everything else is good). I agree that statins may be quite inadequate for the task. I am currently investigating alternative approaches that have, so far, reduced my LDL levels, eg high quality fish oils.\napril said: I'm not worried about it, but my Dr sure is.

If you raise your HDL it will shut the doctor up ;-) Start to take coconut oil, if dont already, and your hdl will jump. When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl. That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones. A high LDL and a low HDL do matter. Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem. LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog. LDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident. Everytime there is an accident they show up to help. Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem. The only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects. Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins? In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women! Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run. Ditto for people over 65. No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner. Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins! So the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better. Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see. By the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion. Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run. I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up.... well you get the picture. ....\nIf the observation that 50% of cardiac problems happen to those with normal or low LDL, and the other 50% happens to those with high LDL does not set off alarms in your brain, will anything? The best evidence seems to suggest that statins do some good, but not by lowering LDL. They are also an antioxident. I tolerated them until my dr quack quack doubled my dose. After dropping statins and aforementioned dr, cholesterol went up about a 100 points to almost 270. Over the next years it settled back to less than 200. HDL was always good, and trig. went down after starting fish oil (Carlson's)\nI think the medical community has done a real good job scaring us as patients into the danger of cholesterol. Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad. Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up. Do statins work in a small amount of people probably. But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time. Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation. I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart. I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins. I now take it to repair the damage. After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly. Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins. A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic. She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors. So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease. Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg. She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't. If you get heart disease it means there is some type of inflammation going on in your body. One of the biggest forms of inflammation comes from high glycation from eating too many carbs.\nMy husband has had good results with time-release Niacin.\nWhat came to my mind when I read the article was my 2nd appt. with my FORMER Endo (also a Dr. Quack Quack) when he TRIED to prescribe a statin drug. When I pointed out to him that my lipids are NORMAL, and specifically that my Cholesterol is 177 (normal is <200), he told me I need to IGNORE the normal ranges listed on my lab results because \"they\" now say that Cholesterol needs to be <100. I didn't believe him and told him that I will not take any statins. He wasn't happy with me, but I wasn't going to allow him to sway me.

Click to expand... It is my understanding that a LC/HF diet improves your lipid numbers, but I'm not 100% on that. Maybe some others can chime in that have issues with lipids and they can share how they lowered their numbers. I've never had a problem with my lipid numbers before or after dx, but I do think that is a strong genetic component. I've known some people who eat very healthy and they exercise like crazy and they still have high cholesterol.\nI was only on statins for 15 months and my bgs were higher, especially towards the last few months when I had a lot of joint and muscle pain. I think like a lot of other drugs statins may cause inflammation and it is the inflammation that caused my higher bgs. But doesn't inflammation also cause heart disease? So I really don't think how they can see there is any benefit . A lot of us use a LC/HF diet to manage cholesterol. It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy. Dr William Davis a cardiologist and author of Wheat Belly has a specific diet for promoting heart health. He believes in Low Carb and moderate fat. Dr Michael Eades also has a blog that pushes LC for heart health. Little by little doctors are coming around that the important number is your HDL number. Get it as high as possible and that will improve overall health.\napril said: ... I stopped taking mine, and after 3 days that ache all over feeling went.

Your cholesterol level is what it is. Your liver decides how much cholesterol it needs to make. It it understands your body's cholesterol needs really well. So don't second guess it.\nI'm not worried about it, but my Dr sure is. It was at it's highest 6 I remember, and she said 4 or below is what she wants a diabetic to have. Is it not dangerous then walking around with a high cholesterol count?\napril said: ... Is it not dangerous then walking around with a high cholesterol count? Click to expand... Mmmm ... maybe it is. You could be run over by a bus. But seriously, nearly half the heart attacks happen to people with low or normal cholesterol. So it seems that walking around with low or normal cholesterol is almost as dangerous as walking around with high cholesterol.\napril said: I'm not worried about it, but my Dr sure is.

I share your concerns & agree with you that if the docs are worried about it, then so should we. I know there is a strong opinion on internet sites that cholesterol doesn't matter & that we should ignore medical advice on this but I don't buy that anymore. The liver may want to produce high LDL cholesterol, but that doesn't mean it may be a healthy thing. (I have high LDL, everything else is good). I agree that statins may be quite inadequate for the task. I am currently investigating alternative approaches that have, so far, reduced my LDL levels, eg high quality fish oils.\napril said: I'm not worried about it, but my Dr sure is.

If you raise your HDL it will shut the doctor up ;-) Start to take coconut oil, if dont already, and your hdl will jump. When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl. That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones. A high LDL and a low HDL do matter. Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem. LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog. LDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident. Everytime there is an accident they show up to help. Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem. The only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects. Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins? In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women! Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run. Ditto for people over 65. No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner. Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins! So the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better. Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see. By the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion. Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run. I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up.... well you get the picture. ....\nIf the observation that 50% of cardiac problems happen to those with normal or low LDL, and the other 50% happens to those with high LDL does not set off alarms in your brain, will anything? The best evidence seems to suggest that statins do some good, but not by lowering LDL. They are also an antioxident. I tolerated them until my dr quack quack doubled my dose. After dropping statins and aforementioned dr, cholesterol went up about a 100 points to almost 270. Over the next years it settled back to less than 200. HDL was always good, and trig. went down after starting fish oil (Carlson's)\nI think the medical community has done a real good job scaring us as patients into the danger of cholesterol. Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad. Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up. Do statins work in a small amount of people probably. But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time. Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation. I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart. I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins. I now take it to repair the damage. After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly. Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins. A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic. She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors. So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease. Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg. She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't. If you get heart disease it means there is some type of inflammation going on in your body. One of the biggest forms of inflammation comes from high glycation from eating too many carbs.\nMy husband has had good results with time-release Niacin.\nWhat came to my mind when I read the article was my 2nd appt. with my FORMER Endo (also a Dr. Quack Quack) when he TRIED to prescribe a statin drug. When I pointed out to him that my lipids are NORMAL, and specifically that my Cholesterol is 177 (normal is <200), he told me I need to IGNORE the normal ranges listed on my lab results because \"they\" now say that Cholesterol needs to be <100. I didn't believe him and told him that I will not take any statins. He wasn't happy with me, but I wasn't going to allow him to sway me. I shudder to think that Dr. Quack Quack was ACTUALLY going to give me medication to MAKE my Diabetes WORSE. So, glad that I dodged that bullet.\nRob said: They are also an antioxident.

Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad. Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up. Do statins work in a small amount of people probably. But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time. Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation. I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart. I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins. I now take it to repair the damage. After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly. Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins. A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic. She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors. So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease. Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg. She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't. If you get heart disease it means there is some type of inflammation going on in your body. One of the biggest forms of inflammation comes from high glycation from eating too many carbs.\nMy husband has had good results with time-release Niacin.\nWhat came to my mind when I read the article was my 2nd appt. with my FORMER Endo (also a Dr. Quack Quack) when he TRIED to prescribe a statin drug. When I pointed out to him that my lipids are NORMAL, and specifically that my Cholesterol is 177 (normal is <200), he told me I need to IGNORE the normal ranges listed on my lab results because \"they\" now say that Cholesterol needs to be <100. I didn't believe him and told him that I will not take any statins. He wasn't happy with me, but I wasn't going to allow him to sway me.

Maybe some others can chime in that have issues with lipids and they can share how they lowered their numbers. I've never had a problem with my lipid numbers before or after dx, but I do think that is a strong genetic component. I've known some people who eat very healthy and they exercise like crazy and they still have high cholesterol.\nI was only on statins for 15 months and my bgs were higher, especially towards the last few months when I had a lot of joint and muscle pain. I think like a lot of other drugs statins may cause inflammation and it is the inflammation that caused my higher bgs. But doesn't inflammation also cause heart disease? So I really don't think how they can see there is any benefit . A lot of us use a LC/HF diet to manage cholesterol. It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy. Dr William Davis a cardiologist and author of Wheat Belly has a specific diet for promoting heart health. He believes in Low Carb and moderate fat. Dr Michael Eades also has a blog that pushes LC for heart health. Little by little doctors are coming around that the important number is your HDL number. Get it as high as possible and that will improve overall health.\napril said: ... I stopped taking mine, and after 3 days that ache all over feeling went.

Your cholesterol level is what it is. Your liver decides how much cholesterol it needs to make. It it understands your body's cholesterol needs really well. So don't second guess it.\nI'm not worried about it, but my Dr sure is. It was at it's highest 6 I remember, and she said 4 or below is what she wants a diabetic to have.

You could be run over by a bus. But seriously, nearly half the heart attacks happen to people with low or normal cholesterol. So it seems that walking around with low or normal cholesterol is almost as dangerous as walking around with high cholesterol.\napril said: I'm not worried about it, but my Dr sure is.

I share your concerns & agree with you that if the docs are worried about it, then so should we. I know there is a strong opinion on internet sites that cholesterol doesn't matter & that we should ignore medical advice on this but I don't buy that anymore. The liver may want to produce high LDL cholesterol, but that doesn't mean it may be a healthy thing. (I have high LDL, everything else is good). I agree that statins may be quite inadequate for the task. I am currently investigating alternative approaches that have, so far, reduced my LDL levels, eg high quality fish oils.\napril said: I'm not worried about it, but my Dr sure is.

If you raise your HDL it will shut the doctor up ;-) Start to take coconut oil, if dont already, and your hdl will jump. When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl. That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones. A high LDL and a low HDL do matter. Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem. LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog. LDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident. Everytime there is an accident they show up to help. Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem. The only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects. Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins? In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women! Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run. Ditto for people over 65. No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner. Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins! So the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better. Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see. By the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion. Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run. I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up.... well you get the picture. ....\nIf the observation that 50% of cardiac problems happen to those with normal or low LDL, and the other 50% happens to those with high LDL does not set off alarms in your brain, will anything? The best evidence seems to suggest that statins do some good, but not by lowering LDL. They are also an antioxident. I tolerated them until my dr quack quack doubled my dose.

Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem. LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog. LDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident. Everytime there is an accident they show up to help. Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem. The only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects. Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins? In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women! Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run. Ditto for people over 65. No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner. Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins! So the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better. Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see. By the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion. Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run. I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up.... well you get the picture. ....\nIf the observation that 50% of cardiac problems happen to those with normal or low LDL, and the other 50% happens to those with high LDL does not set off alarms in your brain, will anything? The best evidence seems to suggest that statins do some good, but not by lowering LDL. They are also an antioxident. I tolerated them until my dr quack quack doubled my dose. After dropping statins and aforementioned dr, cholesterol went up about a 100 points to almost 270. Over the next years it settled back to less than 200. HDL was always good, and trig. went down after starting fish oil (Carlson's)\nI think the medical community has done a real good job scaring us as patients into the danger of cholesterol. Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad. Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up. Do statins work in a small amount of people probably. But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time. Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation. I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart. I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins. I now take it to repair the damage. After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly. Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins. A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic. She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors. So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease. Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg. She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't. If you get heart disease it means there is some type of inflammation going on in your body. One of the biggest forms of inflammation comes from high glycation from eating too many carbs.\nMy husband has had good results with time-release Niacin.\nWhat came to my mind when I read the article was my 2nd appt. with my FORMER Endo (also a Dr. Quack Quack) when he TRIED to prescribe a statin drug. When I pointed out to him that my lipids are NORMAL, and specifically that my Cholesterol is 177 (normal is <200), he told me I need to IGNORE the normal ranges listed on my lab results because \"they\" now say that Cholesterol needs to be <100. I didn't believe him and told him that I will not take any statins. He wasn't happy with me, but I wasn't going to allow him to sway me. I shudder to think that Dr. Quack Quack was ACTUALLY going to give me medication to MAKE my Diabetes WORSE. So, glad that I dodged that bullet.\nRob said: They are also an antioxident.

So I really don't think how they can see there is any benefit . A lot of us use a LC/HF diet to manage cholesterol. It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy. Dr William Davis a cardiologist and author of Wheat Belly has a specific diet for promoting heart health. He believes in Low Carb and moderate fat. Dr Michael Eades also has a blog that pushes LC for heart health. Little by little doctors are coming around that the important number is your HDL number.

Your cholesterol level is what it is. Your liver decides how much cholesterol it needs to make. It it understands your body's cholesterol needs really well. So don't second guess it.\nI'm not worried about it, but my Dr sure is. It was at it's highest 6 I remember, and she said 4 or below is what she wants a diabetic to have.

I know there is a strong opinion on internet sites that cholesterol doesn't matter & that we should ignore medical advice on this but I don't buy that anymore. The liver may want to produce high LDL cholesterol, but that doesn't mean it may be a healthy thing. (I have high LDL, everything else is good). I agree that statins may be quite inadequate for the task. I am currently investigating alternative approaches that have, so far, reduced my LDL levels, eg high quality fish oils.\napril said: I'm not worried about it, but my Dr sure is.

Your cholesterol level is what it is. Your liver decides how much cholesterol it needs to make. It it understands your body's cholesterol needs really well. So don't second guess it.\nI'm not worried about it, but my Dr sure is. It was at it's highest 6 I remember, and she said 4 or below is what she wants a diabetic to have.

You could be run over by a bus. But seriously, nearly half the heart attacks happen to people with low or normal cholesterol.

I share your concerns & agree with you that if the docs are worried about it, then so should we. I know there is a strong opinion on internet sites that cholesterol doesn't matter & that we should ignore medical advice on this but I don't buy that anymore. The liver may want to produce high LDL cholesterol, but that doesn't mean it may be a healthy thing. (I have high LDL, everything else is good). I agree that statins may be quite inadequate for the task. I am currently investigating alternative approaches that have, so far, reduced my LDL levels, eg high quality fish oils.\napril said: I'm not worried about it, but my Dr sure is.

If you raise your HDL it will shut the doctor up ;-) Start to take coconut oil, if dont already, and your hdl will jump. When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl. That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones. A high LDL and a low HDL do matter. Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem. LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog. LDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident. Everytime there is an accident they show up to help. Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem. The only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects. Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins? In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women! Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run. Ditto for people over 65. No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner. Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins! So the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better. Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see. By the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion. Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run. I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up.... well you get the picture. ....\nIf the observation that 50% of cardiac problems happen to those with normal or low LDL, and the other 50% happens to those with high LDL does not set off alarms in your brain, will anything? The best evidence seems to suggest that statins do some good, but not by lowering LDL. They are also an antioxident. I tolerated them until my dr quack quack doubled my dose. After dropping statins and aforementioned dr, cholesterol went up about a 100 points to almost 270. Over the next years it settled back to less than 200. HDL was always good, and trig. went down after starting fish oil (Carlson's)\nI think the medical community has done a real good job scaring us as patients into the danger of cholesterol. Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad. Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up. Do statins work in a small amount of people probably. But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time. Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation. I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart. I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins. I now take it to repair the damage. After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly. Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins. A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic. She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors. So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease. Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg. She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't. If you get heart disease it means there is some type of inflammation going on in your body. One of the biggest forms of inflammation comes from high glycation from eating too many carbs.\nMy husband has had good results with time-release Niacin.\nWhat came to my mind when I read the article was my 2nd appt. with my FORMER Endo (also a Dr. Quack Quack) when he TRIED to prescribe a statin drug. When I pointed out to him that my lipids are NORMAL, and specifically that my Cholesterol is 177 (normal is <200), he told me I need to IGNORE the normal ranges listed on my lab results because \"they\" now say that Cholesterol needs to be <100. I didn't believe him and told him that I will not take any statins. He wasn't happy with me, but I wasn't going to allow him to sway me. I shudder to think that Dr. Quack Quack was ACTUALLY going to give me medication to MAKE my Diabetes WORSE. So, glad that I dodged that bullet.\nRob said: They are also an antioxident.

Maybe some others can chime in that have issues with lipids and they can share how they lowered their numbers.

I think like a lot of other drugs statins may cause inflammation and it is the inflammation that caused my higher bgs. But doesn't inflammation also cause heart disease? So I really don't think how they can see there is any benefit . A lot of us use a LC/HF diet to manage cholesterol. It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy.

That jupitor report on the statin crestor proved it caused diabetis and the FDA approved it anyway saying it was a minor side effect.

I guess it is better than nothing...\nI did ask on the other thread re - statins. I stopped taking mine, and after 3 days that ache all over feeling went. I was wondering if there was something I could take to lower my cholestrol, as low fat diets don't change much. Any advice?\napril said: I did ask on the other thread re - statins.

Click to expand... It is my understanding that a LC/HF diet improves your lipid numbers, but I'm not 100% on that. Maybe some others can chime in that have issues with lipids and they can share how they lowered their numbers. I've never had a problem with my lipid numbers before or after dx, but I do think that is a strong genetic component. I've known some people who eat very healthy and they exercise like crazy and they still have high cholesterol.\nI was only on statins for 15 months and my bgs were higher, especially towards the last few months when I had a lot of joint and muscle pain. I think like a lot of other drugs statins may cause inflammation and it is the inflammation that caused my higher bgs. But doesn't inflammation also cause heart disease? So I really don't think how they can see there is any benefit . A lot of us use a LC/HF diet to manage cholesterol. It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy. Dr William Davis a cardiologist and author of Wheat Belly has a specific diet for promoting heart health. He believes in Low Carb and moderate fat. Dr Michael Eades also has a blog that pushes LC for heart health. Little by little doctors are coming around that the important number is your HDL number. Get it as high as possible and that will improve overall health.\napril said: ... I stopped taking mine, and after 3 days that ache all over feeling went. I was wondering if there was something I could take to lower my cholestrol, as low fat diets don't change much. Any advice? Click to expand... My advice is don't worry about it. Your cholesterol level is what it is. Your liver decides how much cholesterol it needs to make. It it understands your body's cholesterol needs really well. So don't second guess it.\nI'm not worried about it, but my Dr sure is. It was at it's highest 6 I remember, and she said 4 or below is what she wants a diabetic to have. Is it not dangerous then walking around with a high cholesterol count?\napril said: ... Is it not dangerous then walking around with a high cholesterol count? Click to expand... Mmmm ... maybe it is. You could be run over by a bus. But seriously, nearly half the heart attacks happen to people with low or normal cholesterol. So it seems that walking around with low or normal cholesterol is almost as dangerous as walking around with high cholesterol.\napril said: I'm not worried about it, but my Dr sure is.

I share your concerns & agree with you that if the docs are worried about it, then so should we. I know there is a strong opinion on internet sites that cholesterol doesn't matter & that we should ignore medical advice on this but I don't buy that anymore. The liver may want to produce high LDL cholesterol, but that doesn't mean it may be a healthy thing. (I have high LDL, everything else is good). I agree that statins may be quite inadequate for the task. I am currently investigating alternative approaches that have, so far, reduced my LDL levels, eg high quality fish oils.\napril said: I'm not worried about it, but my Dr sure is.

If you raise your HDL it will shut the doctor up ;-) Start to take coconut oil, if dont already, and your hdl will jump. When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl. That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones. A high LDL and a low HDL do matter. Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem. LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog. LDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident. Everytime there is an accident they show up to help. Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem. The only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects. Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins? In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women! Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run. Ditto for people over 65. No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner. Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins! So the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better. Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see. By the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion. Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run. I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up.... well you get the picture. ....\nIf the observation that 50% of cardiac problems happen to those with normal or low LDL, and the other 50% happens to those with high LDL does not set off alarms in your brain, will anything? The best evidence seems to suggest that statins do some good, but not by lowering LDL. They are also an antioxident. I tolerated them until my dr quack quack doubled my dose. After dropping statins and aforementioned dr, cholesterol went up about a 100 points to almost 270. Over the next years it settled back to less than 200. HDL was always good, and trig. went down after starting fish oil (Carlson's)\nI think the medical community has done a real good job scaring us as patients into the danger of cholesterol. Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad. Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up. Do statins work in a small amount of people probably. But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time. Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation. I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart. I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins. I now take it to repair the damage. After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly. Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins. A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic. She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors. So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease. Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg. She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't. If you get heart disease it means there is some type of inflammation going on in your body. One of the biggest forms of inflammation comes from high glycation from eating too many carbs.\nMy husband has had good results with time-release Niacin.\nWhat came to my mind when I read the article was my 2nd appt. with my FORMER Endo (also a Dr. Quack Quack) when he TRIED to prescribe a statin drug. When I pointed out to him that my lipids are NORMAL, and specifically that my Cholesterol is 177 (normal is <200), he told me I need to IGNORE the normal ranges listed on my lab results because \"they\" now say that Cholesterol needs to be <100. I didn't believe him and told him that I will not take any statins. He wasn't happy with me, but I wasn't going to allow him to sway me.

I was wondering if there was something I could take to lower my cholestrol, as low fat diets don't change much. Any advice?\napril said: I did ask on the other thread re - statins.

Click to expand... It is my understanding that a LC/HF diet improves your lipid numbers, but I'm not 100% on that. Maybe some others can chime in that have issues with lipids and they can share how they lowered their numbers. I've never had a problem with my lipid numbers before or after dx, but I do think that is a strong genetic component. I've known some people who eat very healthy and they exercise like crazy and they still have high cholesterol.\nI was only on statins for 15 months and my bgs were higher, especially towards the last few months when I had a lot of joint and muscle pain. I think like a lot of other drugs statins may cause inflammation and it is the inflammation that caused my higher bgs. But doesn't inflammation also cause heart disease? So I really don't think how they can see there is any benefit . A lot of us use a LC/HF diet to manage cholesterol. It will never go as low as a statin drug pushes it but then there is debate about wheter those low numbers are healthy. Dr William Davis a cardiologist and author of Wheat Belly has a specific diet for promoting heart health. He believes in Low Carb and moderate fat. Dr Michael Eades also has a blog that pushes LC for heart health. Little by little doctors are coming around that the important number is your HDL number. Get it as high as possible and that will improve overall health.\napril said: ... I stopped taking mine, and after 3 days that ache all over feeling went. I was wondering if there was something I could take to lower my cholestrol, as low fat diets don't change much. Any advice? Click to expand... My advice is don't worry about it. Your cholesterol level is what it is. Your liver decides how much cholesterol it needs to make. It it understands your body's cholesterol needs really well. So don't second guess it.\nI'm not worried about it, but my Dr sure is. It was at it's highest 6 I remember, and she said 4 or below is what she wants a diabetic to have. Is it not dangerous then walking around with a high cholesterol count?\napril said: ... Is it not dangerous then walking around with a high cholesterol count? Click to expand... Mmmm ... maybe it is. You could be run over by a bus. But seriously, nearly half the heart attacks happen to people with low or normal cholesterol. So it seems that walking around with low or normal cholesterol is almost as dangerous as walking around with high cholesterol.\napril said: I'm not worried about it, but my Dr sure is. It was at it's highest 6 I remember, and she said 4 or below is what she wants a diabetic to have. Is it not dangerous then walking around with a high cholesterol count? Click to expand... I share your concerns & agree with you that if the docs are worried about it, then so should we. I know there is a strong opinion on internet sites that cholesterol doesn't matter & that we should ignore medical advice on this but I don't buy that anymore. The liver may want to produce high LDL cholesterol, but that doesn't mean it may be a healthy thing. (I have high LDL, everything else is good). I agree that statins may be quite inadequate for the task. I am currently investigating alternative approaches that have, so far, reduced my LDL levels, eg high quality fish oils.\napril said: I'm not worried about it, but my Dr sure is. It was at it's highest 6 I remember, and she said 4 or below is what she wants a diabetic to have. Is it not dangerous then walking around with a high cholesterol count? Click to expand... If you raise your HDL it will shut the doctor up ;-) Start to take coconut oil, if dont already, and your hdl will jump. When the doctor says anything about the lipids, point out the high hdl. That is a factor that points to low CVD risk and the HDL/LDL ratio also makes the LDL be the large fluffy and harmless ones. A high LDL and a low HDL do matter. Not because the ldl is bad in and of itself, but becase it is indicating a problem. LDL carries the \"tire patch\" of the body to places it is needed to patch up weak spots, ie blood vessels, but if it has to keep slopping patch on weak spots you then can end up with a clog. LDL is sorta like the ambulance crew on the scene of an accident. Everytime there is an accident they show up to help. Getting rid of the ambulance, which is what statins do, does not remove the problem, because they are not the problem but a sign of the real problem. The only thing that some statins do to help is reduce inflammation, which can be done easier and cheaper by other drugs and methods that dont carry such bad side effects. Do you know that no woman has been shown in any research to have ANY help from statins? In fact it has been shown that statins cause increased death rates in women! Their wording is it raises the all cause mortality in women, but that is what it means in the long run. Ditto for people over 65. No, I refused statins and handled by lipids in a different manner. Mine are now in ideal range and without the use of statins! So the long term answer is to strengthen the blood vessels and the short term answer is to increase your HDL, so your hdl/ldl ratio is better. Makes the ldl the large fluffy kind the doctors like to see. By the way, a high carb diet causes high cho, in my opinion. Triglycerides are carrying around sugars and lowering your a1c and bgs will help lower and improve your lipids in the long run. I think sugars are part of what causes the blood vessels to get damaged in the first place...which makes weak spots...which causes ldl to elevate as it rushes to patch things up.... well you get the picture. ....\nIf the observation that 50% of cardiac problems happen to those with normal or low LDL, and the other 50% happens to those with high LDL does not set off alarms in your brain, will anything? The best evidence seems to suggest that statins do some good, but not by lowering LDL. They are also an antioxident. I tolerated them until my dr quack quack doubled my dose. After dropping statins and aforementioned dr, cholesterol went up about a 100 points to almost 270. Over the next years it settled back to less than 200. HDL was always good, and trig. went down after starting fish oil (Carlson's)\nI think the medical community has done a real good job scaring us as patients into the danger of cholesterol. Isn't this why they created things like margerines with trans fats and told us eggs , cheese and red meat were bad. Everyone gave up those things but guess what the rate of heart attacks went up. Do statins work in a small amount of people probably. But do we know if those people changed other lifestyle factors at the same time. Maybe it was the weight loss, addition of exercise that lowered inflammation. I guess the thing that worries me is that taking statins destroys the CoQ10 which could damage your heart. I was never told to take CoQ10 while on statins. I now take it to repair the damage. After 2 years some of my muscles are still weaker and kind of shrivelly. Supposedly I was on one of the weakest statins. A good friend of mine was on 40 mg of a statin, was thin and athletic. She had a heart attack a few days after she passed a stress test with flying colors. So the statin or the great lifestyle did not protect her from heart disease. Now, they have doubled he statin to 80 mg. She believes her doctors and thinks it protects her but I don't. If you get heart disease it means there is some type of inflammation going on in your body. One of the biggest forms of inflammation comes from high glycation from eating too many carbs.\nMy husband has had good results with time-release Niacin.\nWhat came to my mind when I read the article was my 2nd appt. with my FORMER Endo (also a Dr. Quack Quack) when he TRIED to prescribe a statin drug. When I pointed out to him that my lipids are NORMAL, and specifically that my Cholesterol is 177 (normal is <200), he told me I need to IGNORE the normal ranges listed on my lab results because \"they\" now say that Cholesterol needs to be <100. I didn't believe him and told him that I will not take any statins. He wasn't happy with me, but I wasn't going to allow him to sway me.

I do the same and I can see what there trying to say but the new diabetics are confused, some are told you can eat whole wheat or whole grain and its ok when for most it isnt I agree with you Karena.\nOkay, but the article says \"So consider no food healthy unless your own one hour post-meal numbers after eating eating them in a meal comes in under 155 mg/dl (8.6 mmol/L) and, ideally, under the 140 mg/dl (7.7 mmol/L) level that, maintained over time, usually results in an A1c in the 5% range.\" There are foods that cause some of us more trouble than any kind of grain. And I'll stand by my idea that if you are going to eat any kind of grain......make it a healthy one.

So I think the article confirms my experience. I cannot believe some of the comments beneath the article. If people do not know how to count carbs for themselves, why are they even commenting?\nHis 2 hour numbers seemed very normal. So is she saying the number we need to be testing for is the 1 hour number to see if we spike . I am one who can't eat any whole grains except for a little sprouted grain once in awhile. When I was watching the clip of Dr Bernstein and Hope Warshaw , he actually took a bite of healthy whole grain bread and then tested his saliva to show the minute it hits your tongue it turns into pure sugar.\nI wasn't fully committed to dietary changes until my internist informed me in April that my liver enzymes were up and that I have a fatty liver. So I spent the first 1.5 weeks withdrawing from my carb addiction, then started following the ADA dietary guidelines, which I faithfully adhered to for 2 months, along with my 8-yr-old Weight Watchers guidelines. I tracked everything I ate (calories/carbs/fat/protein/fiber) but was starving constantly. I kept tweaking the ratios, trying to kill the hunger. In frustration, I started researching Diabetes and discovered that I really DO need to invest in a glucose meter (duh!). That little device has been a godsend. It told me all I needed to know, and for the past 2.5 weeks I've cut my carb intake to 15-20 percent and increased the fat/protein ratios. Turns out I wasn't eating enough fat on WW, since it really hogs the points. Sorry for boring you with all this just to say that I've discovered that grains spike my bg as well. I know this to be true for wheat anyway; haven't experimented yet with oats, rice, or beans. I'll wait until my 3-month checkup at the end of this month before I mess with the good results I'm getting now.\nAll the grains, beans, potatoes etc. spike me. Doesn't matter if they're whole grain and have lots of fiber. Also they put weight on me like crazy. If only I had known this decades ago when I was always battling my weight.\nCallMeCat said: I wasn't fully committed to dietary changes until my internist informed me in April that my liver enzymes were up and that I have a fatty liver.

Oh believe me what you posted is very helpful, its my same experience. I cant handle, rice, oats or any other thing like that, I think there are different levels of type 2 we know that but thats why we dont fit the eat this and you can handle it and lose weight and have good numbers.\njeanne wagner said: His 2 hour numbers seemed very normal.

I think I will start the one hour testing.\nI peak at 45 min. Fairly consistently.\nOh yeah for sure, I found that out early on and the hard way!!!\nIf the carb count is similar, then the amount of blood glucose increase will be similar, however with a lower glycemic index, as is typical in whole grains versus non whole grain, the release into the blood is slower.

I am one of those who refuse to shop Walmart, if at all possible. Earle\nEarle - if your doctor prescribes more strips per day, Medicare will provide them. I did this, and had to submit a list of my daily tests every month. A pain 'not in the finger tips', but whatever....\nI am on Medicare and I am a pump user. My doctor wrote a prescription for testing eight times daily. Medicare filled the prescription at 7 tests daily, based on the detailed 30-day log I had to submit. I need to submit a month-long log every six months to obtain the extra srips my testing requires. So for 5 more months, I will get strips for 7 tests per day.\nSweetType2 said: I saw this yesterday and was pleased. Click to expand... I didn't see it until today... two days after buying a box of 100 Still, that's great news!\nAm glad that they dropped the price, but on going to the WalMart website found that these strips are ONLY for the new ReliOn Prime monitor ($16.95). I use a ReliOn Micro, so will wait until the 100-strip box I got for $37 runs out...\nThat is fantastic!!!! Wouldn't it be nice to have a BG strip war.\nI saw this yesterday and was pleased. I use a ReliOn meter and the strips currently run $37 per 100. I'm sure I'll have to buy the new meter for these cheaper strips but I will definitely try it out.\nThis is big news. At 18 cents the cost of strips is no longer a major expense for diabetics without insurance. It is also low enough to put big pressure on other brands.\nAs someone who tries to avoid giving WalMart any of my money, I can only hope this causes some of the competitors to get a little more in line. Alas, I won't hold my breath...\nNow if they would work on an attitude adjustment of some of their pharmacy staff, maybe some of us that have left would go back but I doubt it.\nI really prefer not to shop there either but I'm thrilled that they are taking pharmaceutical costs lower. I certainly can't say the same for the big pharmacy chains.\nI might have to switch meters. I pay out of pocket for all my supplies. Right now I pay about $15 per box of 50 strips, which is better than most meters, but still this could mean a considerable savings every year for me.\nCallMeMed said: As someone who tries to avoid giving WalMart any of my money, I can only hope this causes some of the competitors to get a little more in line.

    "text": "Type 2 diabetes happens when the body cannot use insulin correctly and sugar builds up in the blood. It was once called adult-onset diabetes.\nOver time, high blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes can damage the eyes, kidneys, nerves and heart. This can happen because the pancreas doesn't make enough of a hormone called insulin that helps sugar enter the cells. It happens also because the cells respond poorly to insulin by taking in less sugar.\nBoth type 1 and type 2 diabetes can begin during childhood and adulthood. Type 2 is more common in older adults. But the increase in the number of children with obesity has led to more young people with type 2 diabetes.\nThere's no cure for type 2 diabetes. Losing weight, eating well and exercising can help manage the condition. If diet and exercise aren't enough to manage blood sugar, diabetes medicines or insulin therapy may help.",

Insulin manages how the body uses sugar in the following ways:\n- Sugar in the bloodstream causes the pancreas to release insulin.\n- Insulin in the bloodstream gets sugar into the cells.\n- The amount of sugar in the bloodstream drops.\n- Then the pancreas releases less insulin.",

    "text": "A sugar called glucose is a main source of energy for the cells that make up muscles and other tissues.\n- Glucose comes from two major sources. They are food and the liver.\n- Glucose goes into the bloodstream. There it enters cells with the help of insulin.\n- The liver stores glucose in the form of glycogen and also makes glucose.\n- When glucose levels are low, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose. This keeps the body's glucose level within a healthy range.\nIn type 2 diabetes, this process doesn't work well. Instead of moving into the cells, sugar builds up in the blood. As blood sugar levels rise, the pancreas releases more insulin. Over time, the cells in the pancreas that make insulin are damaged. Then the cells can't make enough insulin to meet the body's needs.",

    "text": "Factors that may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes include:\n- Excess weight.Being overweight or obese is a main risk.\n- Waist size.Storing fat mainly in the belly rather than in the hips and thighs raises the risk. The risk of type 2 diabetes is higher in people assigned male at birth whose waists measure more than 40 inches (101.6 centimeters). For people assigned female at birth, a waist measure of more than 35 inches (88.9 centimeters) raises the risk.\n- Sitting.The less active a person is, the higher the risk. Physical activity helps manage weight, uses up glucose as energy and helps cells take in insulin.\n- Family history.Having a parent or sibling who has type 2 diabetes raises the risk.\n- Race and ethnicity.It's not clear why, but people of certain races and ethnicities are more likely to get type 2 diabetes than white people are. Races and ethnicities include Black people, Hispanic people, Native American and Asian people, and Pacific Island people.\n- Blood lipid levels.A higher risk is linked with low levels of high-density lipoprotein. Also called HDL cholesterol, this is the \"good\" cholesterol. Higher risk also is linked with high levels of a certain type of fat in the blood, called triglycerides.\n- Age.The risk of type 2 diabetes goes up with age, mainly after age 35.\n- Prediabetes.Prediabetes is a condition in which blood sugar is higher than the standard range, but not high enough to be called type 2 diabetes. If not treated, prediabetes often moves on to become type 2 diabetes.\n- Pregnancy-related risks.The risk of getting type 2 diabetes is higher in people who had gestational diabetes when they were pregnant. And it's higher in those who gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms).\n- Polycystic ovary syndrome.This condition results in irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity. It raises the risk of diabetes.",

    "text": "Type 2 diabetes affects many major organs. These include the heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes and kidneys. Also, factors that raise the risk of diabetes are risk factors for other serious diseases. Managing diabetes and blood sugar can lower the risk for these complications and other medical conditions, including:\n- Heart and blood vessel disease.Diabetes is linked with a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure and narrowed blood vessels, called atherosclerosis.\n- Nerve damage in arms and legs.This condition is called neuropathy. High blood sugar over time can damage or destroy nerves. Neuropathy may cause tingling, numbness, burning, pain or loss of feeling. It most often begins at the tips of the toes or fingers and slowly spreads upward.\n- Other nerve damage.Damage to nerves of the heart can cause irregular heart rhythms. Nerve damage in the digestive system can cause problems with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation. Nerve damage also may cause erectile dysfunction.\n- Kidney disease.Diabetes may lead to long-term kidney disease or end-stage kidney disease that can't be reversed. End-stage kidney disease may need to be treated with mechanical filtering of the kidneys, called dialysis, or a kidney transplant.\n- Eye damage.Diabetes increases the risk of serious eye conditions. Conditions include cataracts and glaucoma. Diabetes also may damage the blood vessels of the retina, which is the part of the eye that senses light. This is called diabetic retinopathy. This damage can lead to blindness.\n- Skin conditions.Diabetes may raise the risk of some skin problems. Skin problems may include bacterial and fungal infections.\n- Slow healing.Cuts and blisters that aren't treated can become serious infections. The infections may heal poorly. Bad damage can result in the need to use surgery to remove a toe, foot or leg. This surgery is called amputation.\n- Hearing impairment.Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes.\n- Sleep apnea.Obstructive sleep apnea is common in people who have type 2 diabetes. Obesity may be the main cause of both conditions.\n- Dementia.Type 2 diabetes seems to raise the risk of Alzheimer's disease and other conditions that cause dementia. Poorly managed blood sugar is linked to a faster loss of memory and other thinking skills.",

    "text": "Healthy lifestyle choices can help prevent type 2 diabetes. If you have prediabetes, lifestyle changes may slow the condition or keep it from becoming diabetes.\nA healthy lifestyle includes the following:\n- Eat healthy foods.Choose foods lower in fat and calories and higher in fiber. Focus on fruits, vegetables and whole grains.\n- Be active.Aim for 150 or more minutes a week of moderate to vigorous aerobic activity, such as brisk walking, bicycling, running or swimming.\n- Lose weight.If you are overweight, losing some weight and keeping it off may slow prediabetes from becoming type 2 diabetes. If you have prediabetes, losing 7% to 10% of your body weight may lower the risk of diabetes.\n- Don't sit for long.Sitting for long periods can raise the risk of type 2 diabetes. Get up every 30 minutes and move around for at least a few minutes.\nPeople with prediabetes may take metformin (Fortamet, Glumetza, others), a diabetes medicine, to lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. This is most often prescribed for older adults who are obese and who can't lower blood sugar levels with lifestyle changes.",
