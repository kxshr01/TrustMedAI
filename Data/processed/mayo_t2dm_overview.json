          "Type 2 diabetes happens when the body cannot use insulin correctly and sugar builds up in the blood. It was once called adult-onset diabetes.",
          "Over time, high blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes can damage the eyes, kidneys, nerves and heart. This can happen because the pancreas doesn't make enough of a hormone called insulin that helps sugar enter the cells. It happens also because the cells respond poorly to insulin by taking in less sugar.",
          "Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes can begin during childhood and adulthood. Type 2 is more common in older adults. But the increase in the number of children with obesity has led to more young people with type 2 diabetes.",
          "There's no cure for type 2 diabetes. Losing weight, eating well and exercising can help manage the condition. If diet and exercise aren't enough to manage blood sugar, diabetes medicines or insulin therapy may help."

          "- When glucose levels are low, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose. This keeps the body's glucose level within a healthy range.",
          "In type 2 diabetes, this process doesn't work well. Instead of moving into the cells, sugar builds up in the blood. As blood sugar levels rise, the pancreas releases more insulin. Over time, the cells in the pancreas that make insulin are damaged. Then the cells can't make enough insulin to meet the body's needs."

The risk of type 2 diabetes is higher in people assigned male at birth whose waists measure more than 40 inches (101.6 centimeters). For people assigned female at birth, a waist measure of more than 35 inches (88.9 centimeters) raises the risk.",
          "- Sitting.The less active a person is, the higher the risk. Physical activity helps manage weight, uses up glucose as energy and helps cells take in insulin.",
          "- Family history.Having a parent or sibling who has type 2 diabetes raises the risk.",
          "- Race and ethnicity.It's not clear why, but people of certain races and ethnicities are more likely to get type 2 diabetes than white people are. Races and ethnicities include Black people, Hispanic people, Native American and Asian people, and Pacific Island people.",
          "- Blood lipid levels.A higher risk is linked with low levels of high-density lipoprotein. Also called HDL cholesterol, this is the \"good\" cholesterol. Higher risk also is linked with high levels of a certain type of fat in the blood, called triglycerides.",
          "- Age.The risk of type 2 diabetes goes up with age, mainly after age 35.",
          "- Prediabetes.Prediabetes is a condition in which blood sugar is higher than the standard range, but not high enough to be called type 2 diabetes. If not treated, prediabetes often moves on to become type 2 diabetes.",
          "- Pregnancy-related risks.The risk of getting type 2 diabetes is higher in people who had gestational diabetes when they were pregnant. And it's higher in those who gave birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds (4 kilograms).",
          "- Polycystic ovary syndrome.This condition results in irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth and obesity. It raises the risk of diabetes."

          "- Eye damage.Diabetes increases the risk of serious eye conditions. Conditions include cataracts and glaucoma. Diabetes also may damage the blood vessels of the retina, which is the part of the eye that senses light. This is called diabetic retinopathy. This damage can lead to blindness.",
          "- Skin conditions.Diabetes may raise the risk of some skin problems. Skin problems may include bacterial and fungal infections.",
          "- Slow healing.Cuts and blisters that aren't treated can become serious infections. The infections may heal poorly. Bad damage can result in the need to use surgery to remove a toe, foot or leg. This surgery is called amputation.",
          "- Hearing impairment.Hearing problems are more common in people with diabetes.",
          "- Sleep apnea.Obstructive sleep apnea is common in people who have type 2 diabetes. Obesity may be the main cause of both conditions.",
