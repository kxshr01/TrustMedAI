The higher the levels, the greater your risk of developing diabetes complications. Your doctor will tell you how often you need the A1C test, but usually you’ll have the test at least twice a year if you’re meeting your treatment goals. If you're not meeting your goals or you change treatments, you may need to get an A1C test more often."

Your doctor might report your A1C results as eAG. eAG is similar to what you see when monitoring your blood glucose at home on your meter.
